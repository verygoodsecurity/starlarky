Code of Conduct
----------------

The Starlarky development effort is a very personal process compared
to "traditional" ways of developing software.  Your code and ideas
behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and
criticism.  The review will almost always require improvements to the
code before it can be included.  Know that this happens because everyone 
involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall success 
of Starlarky. 

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise
uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable.  If so,
please contact the Very Good Security project maintainers at
<starlarky@vgs.io>, or the individual members, and they
will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability. 

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on
the technical issues involved.  We are all humans, and frustrations can
be high on both sides of the process.  Try to keep in mind the immortal
words of Bill and Ted, "Be excellent to each other."
