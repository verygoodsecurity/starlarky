/**
 * The Executor provides the context for the execution of actions. It is only valid during the
 * execution phase, and references should not be cached.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the actual logic to execute actions. The platonic ideal of this system is
 * that {@link Action}s are immutable objects that tell Blaze <b>what</b> to do and
 * <link>ActionContext</link>s tell Blaze <b>how</b> to do it (however, we do have an "execute"
 * method on actions now).
 *
 * <p>In theory, most of the methods below would not exist and they would be methods on action
 * contexts, but in practice, that would require some refactoring work so we are stuck with these
 * for the time being.
 *
 * <p>In theory, we could also merge {@link Executor} with {@link ActionExecutionContext}, since
 * they both provide services to actions being executed and are passed to almost the same places.
