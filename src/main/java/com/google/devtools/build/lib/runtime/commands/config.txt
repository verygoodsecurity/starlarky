Usage: %{product} %{command} <options> [<config_id> | <config_id> <config_id>]

Displays the given configuration objects, if they can be found in the Skyframe cache. The best way
to use this command is to first run a build (or cquery), and then immediately run the config
command to view the configuration. Note that any flags passed to build (or cquery) must also be
passed to config, or else the Skyframe cache will be evicted and no configurations will be found.

If two configuration ids are passed, the difference between them will be computed and displayed,
instead of the entire configurations.

This command is experimental and unsupported.
