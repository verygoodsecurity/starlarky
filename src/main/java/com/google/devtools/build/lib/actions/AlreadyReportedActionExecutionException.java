/**
 * This wrapper exception is used as a marker class to already reported errors. Errors are reported
 * at {@code AbstractBuilder.executeActionTask()} method in case of the builder not aborting in case
 * of exceptions (For example keepgoing).
 *
 * <p>Then In upper levels we wrap catch the exception and throw a BuildFailedException
 * unconditionally, that is caught and shown as error in AbstractBuildCommand (because the message
 * of the exception is !=null).
 *
 * With this exception we detect that the error was already shown and we wrap it in a
 * BuildFailedException without message.
