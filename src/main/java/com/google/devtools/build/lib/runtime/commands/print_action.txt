Usage: %{product} %{command} <options> <targets>

Builds the specified targets and prints the extra actions for the given
targets. Right now, the targets have to be relative paths to source files,
and the --compile_one_dependency option has to be enabled.

This command accepts all valid options to 'build', and inherits defaults for
'build' from your .%{product}rc.  If you don't use .%{product}rc, don't forget to pass
all your 'build' options to '%{command}' too.

See '%{product} help target-syntax' for details and examples on how to
specify targets.
