Usage: %{product} %{command} <options> <profile-files> [<profile-file> ...]

Analyzes build profile data for the given profile data files.

Analyzes each specified profile data file and prints the results.  The
input files must have been produced by the '%{product} build
--profile=file' command.

By default, a summary of the analysis is printed.  For post-processing
with scripts, the --dump=raw option is recommended, causing this
command to dump profile data in easily-parsed format.
