Usage: %{product} %{command} <options> <test-targets>

Builds and runs the specified test targets using the specified options while
collecting code coverage statistics. Optionally, it also generates a combined
HTML report containing coverage results for all executed tests.

This command accepts all valid options to 'test' and 'build', and inherits
defaults for 'test' (and 'build') from your .%{product}rc.  If you don't use
.%{product}rc, don't forget to pass all your 'build' options to '%{command}'
too.

See '%{product} help target-syntax' for details and examples on how to
specify targets.
