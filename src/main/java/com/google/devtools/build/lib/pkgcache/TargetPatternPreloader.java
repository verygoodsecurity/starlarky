/**
 * A preloader for target patterns. Target patterns are a generalisation of labels to include
 * wildcards for finding all packages recursively beneath some root, and for finding all targets
 * within a package.
 *
 * <p>A list of target patterns implies a union of all the labels of each pattern. Each item in a
 * list of target patterns may include a prefix negation operator, indicating that the sets of
 * targets for this pattern should be subtracted from the set of targets for the preceding patterns
 * (note this means that order matters). Thus, the following list of target patterns:
 *
 * <pre>foo/... -foo/bar:all</pre>
 *
 * means "all targets beneath <tt>foo</tt> except for those targets in package <tt>foo/bar</tt>.
