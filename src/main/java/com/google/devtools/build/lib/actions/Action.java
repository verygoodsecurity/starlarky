/**
 * An Action represents a function from Artifacts to Artifacts executed as an atomic build step.
 * Examples include compilation of a single C++ source file, or linking a single library.
 *
 * <p>All subclasses of Action need to follow a strict set of invariants to ensure correctness on
 * incremental builds. In our experience, getting this wrong is a lot more expensive than any
 * benefits it might entail.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.actions.SpawnAction} or {@link
 * com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.actions.FileWriteAction} where possible, and avoid writing
 * a new custom subclass.
 *
 * <p>These are the most important requirements for subclasses:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Actions must be generally immutable; we currently make an exception for C++, and that has
 *       been a constant source of correctness issues; there are still ongoing incremental
 *       correctness issues for C++ compilations, despite several rounds of fixes and even though
 *       this is the oldest part of the code base.
 *   <li>Actions should be as lazy as possible - storing full lists of inputs or full command lines
 *       in every action generally results in quadratic memory consumption. Use {@link
 *       com.google.devtools.build.lib.collect.nestedset.NestedSet} for inputs, and {@link
 *       com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.actions.CustomCommandLine} for command lines where
 *       possible to share as much data between the different actions and their owning configured
 *       targets.
 *   <li>However, actions must not reference configured targets or rule contexts themselves; only
 *       reference the necessary underlying artifacts or strings, preferably as nested sets. Bazel
 *       may attempt to garbage collect configured targets and rule contexts before execution to
 *       keep memory consumption down, and referencing them prevents that.
 *   <li>In particular, avoid anonymous inner classes - when created in a non-static method, they
 *       implicitly keep a reference to their enclosing class, even if that reference is unnecessary
 *       for correct operation. Not doing so has caused significant increases in memory consumption
 *       in the past.
 *   <li>Correct cache key computation in {@link #getKey} is critical for the correctness of
 *       incremental builds; you may be tempted to intentionally exclude data from the cache key,
 *       but be aware that every time we've done that, it later resulted in expensive debugging
 *       sessions and bug fixes.
 *   <li>As much as possible, make the cache key computation obvious - fully hash every field
 *       (except input contents, but including input and output names if they appear in the command
 *       line) in the class, and avoid referencing anything that isn't needed for action execution,
 *       such as {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.config.BuildConfiguration} objects or
 *       even fragments thereof; if the action has a command line, err on the side of hashing the
 *       entire command line, even if that seems expensive. It's always safe to hash too much - the
 *       negative effect on incremental build times is usually negligible.
 *   <li>Add test coverage for the cache key computation; use {@link
 *       com.google.devtools.build.lib.analysis.util.ActionTester} to generate as many combinations
 *       of field values as possible; add test coverage every time you add another field.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These constraints are not easily enforced or tested for (e.g., ActionTester only checks that a
 * known set of fields is covered, not that all fields are covered), so carefully check all changes
 * to action subclasses.
