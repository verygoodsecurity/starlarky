Usage: %{product} info <options> [key]

Displays information about the state of the %{product} process in the
form of several "key: value" pairs.  This includes the locations of
several output directories.  Because some of the
values are affected by the options passed to '%{product} build', the
info command accepts the same set of options.

A single non-option argument may be specified (e.g. "%{product}-bin"), in
which case only the value for that key will be printed.

If --show_make_env is specified, the output includes the set of key/value
pairs in the "Make" environment, accessible within BUILD files.

The full list of keys and the meaning of their values is documented in
the %{product} User Manual, and can be programmatically obtained with
'%{product} help info-keys'.

See also '%{product} version' for more detailed %{product} version
information.
