<p><code>List of <a href="../build-ref.html#labels">labels</a>; optional</code></p>

<p>
A list of dependencies of this rule.
</p>

<p>
The precise semantics of what it means for this rule to depend on
another using <code>deps</code> are specific to the kind of this rule,
and the rule-specific documentation below goes into more detail.
At a minimum, though, the targets named via <code>deps</code> will
appear in the <code>*.runfiles</code> area of this rule, if it has
one.
</p>

<p>
Most often, a <code>deps</code> dependency is used to allow one
module to use symbols defined in another module written in the
same programming language and separately compiled.  Cross-language
dependencies are also permitted in many cases: for example,
a <code>java_library</code> rule may depend on C++ code in
a <code>cc_library</code> rule, by declaring the latter in
the <code>deps</code> attribute.  See the definition
of <a href="../build-ref.html#deps">dependencies</a> for more
information.
</p>

<p>
Almost all rules permit a <code>deps</code> attribute, but where
this attribute is not allowed, this fact is documented under the
specific rule.
