    /**
     * Requests {@code depKeys} "in parallel", independent of each others' values. These keys may be
     * thought of as a "dependency group" -- they are requested together by this value.
     *
     * <p>In general, if the result of one getValue call can affect the argument of a later getValue
     * call, the two calls cannot be merged into a single getValues call, since the result of the
     * first call might change on a later evaluation. Inversely, if the result of one getValue call
     * cannot affect the parameters of the next getValue call, the two keys can form a dependency
     * group and the two getValue calls should be merged into one getValues call. In the latter
     * case, if we fail to combine the _multiple_ getValue (or getValues) calls into one _single_
     * getValues call, it would result in multiple dependency groups with an implicit ordering
     * between them. This would unnecessarily cause sequential evaluations of these groups and could
     * impact overall performance.
     *
     * <p>On subsequent evaluations, when checking to see if dependencies require re-evaluation, all
     * the values within one group may be simultaneously checked. A SkyFunction should request a
     * dependency group if checking the deps serially on a subsequent evaluation would take too
     * long, and if the {@link #compute} method would request all deps anyway as long as no earlier
     * deps had changed. SkyFunction.Environment implementations may also choose to request these
     * deps in parallel on the first evaluation, potentially speeding it up.
     *
     * <p>While re-evaluating every value in the group may take longer than re-evaluating just the
     * first one and finding that it has changed, no extra work is done: the contract of the
     * dependency group means that the {@link #compute} method, when called to re-evaluate this
     * value, will request all values in the group again anyway, so they would have to have been
     * built in any case.
     *
     * <p>Example of when to use getValues: A ListProcessor value is built with key inputListRef.
     * The {@link #compute} method first calls getValue(InputList.key(inputListRef)), and retrieves
     * inputList. It then iterates through inputList, calling getValue on each input. Finally, it
     * processes the whole list and returns. Say inputList is (a, b, c). Since the {@link #compute}
     * method will unconditionally call getValue(a), getValue(b), and getValue (c), the {@link
     * #compute} method can instead just call getValues({a, b, c}). If the value is later dirtied
     * the evaluator will evaluate a, b, and c in parallel (assuming the inputList value was
     * unchanged), and re-evaluate the ListProcessor value only if at least one of them was changed.
     * On the other hand, if the InputList changes to be (a, b, d), then the evaluator will see that
     * the first dep has changed, and call the {@link #compute} method to re-evaluate from scratch,
     * without considering the dep group of {a, b, c}.
     *
     * <p>Example of when not to use getValues: A BestMatch value is built with key
     * &lt;potentialMatchesRef, matchCriterion&gt;. The {@link #compute} method first calls
     * getValue(PotentialMatches.key(potentialMatchesRef) and retrieves potentialMatches. It then
     * iterates through potentialMatches, calling getValue on each potential match until it finds
     * one that satisfies matchCriterion. In this case, if potentialMatches is (a, b, c), it would
     * be <i>incorrect</i> to call getValues({a, b, c}), because it is not known yet whether
     * requesting b or c will be necessary -- if a matches, then we will never call b or c.
     *
     * <p>Returns a map, {@code m}. For all {@code k} in {@code depKeys}, {@code m.containsKey(k)}
     * is {@code true}, and, {@code m.get(k) != null} iff the dependency was already evaluated and
