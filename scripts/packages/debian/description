Bazel is a tool that automates software builds and tests. Supported
build tasks include running compilers and linkers to produce
executable programs and libraries, and assembling deployable
packages for Android, iOS and other target environments. Bazel is
similar to other tools like Make, Ant, Gradle, Buck, Pants and Maven.
