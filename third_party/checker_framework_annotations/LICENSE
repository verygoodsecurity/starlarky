A few parts of the Checker Framework have more permissive licenses.

 * The annotations are licensed under the MIT License.  (The text of this
   license appears below.)  More specifically, all the parts of the Checker
   Framework that you might want to include with your own program use the
   MIT License.  This is the checker-qual.jar file and all the files that
   appear in it:  every file in a qual/ directory, plus utility files such
   as NullnessUtil.java, RegexUtil.java, SignednessUtil.java, etc.
   In addition, the cleanroom implementations of third-party annotations,
   which the Checker Framework recognizes as aliases for its own
   annotations, are licensed under the MIT License.
