# Converting CocoaPods dependencies

CocoaPods is a third-party dependency management system for Apple application
development.

[PodToBUILD](https://github.com/pinterest/PodToBUILD) provides a
`repository_rule` to automatically generate [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
Bazel packages that are compatible with [Tulsi](https://tulsi.bazel.build/).
