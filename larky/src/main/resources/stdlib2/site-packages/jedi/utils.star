def setup_readline(namespace_module=__main__, fuzzy=False):
    """

        This function sets up :mod:`readline` to use Jedi in a Python interactive
        shell.

        If you want to use a custom ``PYTHONSTARTUP`` file (typically
        ``$HOME/.pythonrc.py``), you can add this piece of code::

            try:
                from jedi.utils import setup_readline
            except ImportError:
                # Fallback to the stdlib readline completer if it is installed.
                # Taken from http://docs.python.org/2/library/rlcompleter.html
                print("Jedi is not installed, falling back to readline")
                try:
                    import readline
                    import rlcompleter
                    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
                except ImportError:
                    print("Readline is not installed either. No tab completion is enabled.")
            else:
                setup_readline()

        This will fallback to the readline completer if Jedi is not installed.
        The readline completer will only complete names in the global namespace,
        so for example::

            ran<TAB>

        will complete to ``range``.

        With Jedi the following code::

            range(10).cou<TAB>

        will complete to ``range(10).count``, this does not work with the default
        cPython :mod:`readline` completer.

        You will also need to add ``export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc.py`` to
        your shell profile (usually ``.bash_profile`` or ``.profile`` if you use
        bash).

    def JediRL(object):
    """

                This complete stuff is pretty weird, a generator would make
                a lot more sense, but probably due to backwards compatibility
                this is still the way how it works.

                The only important part is stuff in the ``state == 0`` flow,
                everything else has been copied from the ``rlcompleter`` std.
                library module.

def version_info():
    """

        Returns a namedtuple of Jedi's version, similar to Python's
        ``sys.version_info``.
