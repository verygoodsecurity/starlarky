    Returns the current click context.  This can be used as a way to
        access the current context object from anywhere.  This is a more implicit

        primarily useful for helpers such as :func:`echo` which might be
        interested in changing its behavior based on the current context.

        To push the current context, :meth:`Context.scope` can be used.
