        Prints a message plus a newline to the given file or stdout.  On
            first sight, this looks like the print function, but it has improved
            support for handling Unicode and binary data that does not fail no
            matter how badly configured the system is.

            Primarily it means that you can print binary data as well as Unicode
            data on both 2.x and 3.x to the given file in the most appropriate way
            possible.  This is a very carefree function in that it will try its
            best to not fail.  As of Click 6.0 this includes support for unicode
            output on the Windows console.

            In addition to that, if `colorama`_ is installed, the echo function will
            also support clever handling of ANSI codes.  Essentially it will then
            do the following:

            -   add transparent handling of ANSI color codes on Windows.
            -   hide ANSI codes automatically if the destination file is not a
                terminal.

               As of Click 6.0 the echo function will properly support unicode
               output on the windows console.  Not that click does not modify
               the interpreter in any way which means that `sys.stdout` or the
               print statement or function will still not provide unicode support.

            .. versionchanged:: 2.0
               Starting with version 2.0 of Click, the echo function will work
               with colorama if it's installed.
