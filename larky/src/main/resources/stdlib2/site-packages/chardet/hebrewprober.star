         The normal Tsadi is not a good Non-Final letter due to words like
         'lechotet' (to chat) containing an apostrophe after the tsadi. This
         apostrophe is converted to a space in FilterWithoutEnglishLetters
         causing the Non-Final tsadi to appear at an end of a word even
         though this is not the case in the original text.
         The letters Pe and Kaf rarely display a related behavior of not being
         a good Non-Final letter. Words like 'Pop', 'Winamp' and 'Mubarak'
         for example legally end with a Non-Final Pe or Kaf. However, the
         benefit of these letters as Non-Final letters outweighs the damage
         since these words are quite rare.

         Final letter analysis for logical-visual decision.
         Look for evidence that the received buffer is either logical Hebrew
         or visual Hebrew.
         The following cases are checked:
         1) A word longer than 1 letter, ending with a final letter. This is
            an indication that the text is laid out "naturally" since the
            final letter really appears at the end. +1 for logical score.
         2) A word longer than 1 letter, ending with a Non-Final letter. In
            normal Hebrew, words ending with Kaf, Mem, Nun, Pe or Tsadi,
            should not end with the Non-Final form of that letter. Exceptions
            to this rule are mentioned above in isNonFinal(). This is an
            indication that the text is laid out backwards. +1 for visual
            score
         3) A word longer than 1 letter, starting with a final letter. Final
            letters should not appear at the beginning of a word. This is an
            indication that the text is laid out backwards. +1 for visual
            score.

         The visual score and logical score are accumulated throughout the
         text and are finally checked against each other in GetCharSetName().
         No checking for final letters in the middle of words is done since
         that case is not an indication for either Logical or Visual text.

         We automatically filter out all 7-bit characters (replace them with
         spaces) so the word boundary detection works properly. [MAP]
