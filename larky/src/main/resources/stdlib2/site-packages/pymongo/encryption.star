        Explicit client-side field level encryption.

                The ClientEncryption class encapsulates explicit operations on a key
                vault collection that cannot be done directly on a MongoClient. Similar
                to configuring auto encryption on a MongoClient, it is constructed with
                a MongoClient (to a MongoDB cluster containing the key vault
                collection), KMS provider configuration, and keyVaultNamespace. It
                provides an API for explicitly encrypting and decrypting values, and
                creating data keys. It does not provide an API to query keys from the
                key vault collection, as this can be done directly on the MongoClient.

                See :ref:`explicit-client-side-encryption` for an example.

                :Parameters:
                  - `kms_providers`: Map of KMS provider options. Two KMS providers
                    are supported: "aws" and "local". The kmsProviders map values
                    differ by provider:

                      - `aws`: Map with "accessKeyId" and "secretAccessKey" as strings.
                        These are the AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key used
                        to generate KMS messages.
                      - `azure`: Map with "tenantId", "clientId", and "clientSecret" as
                        strings. Additionally, "identityPlatformEndpoint" may also be
                        specified as a string (defaults to 'login.microsoftonline.com').
                        These are the Azure Active Directory credentials used to
                        generate Azure Key Vault messages.
                      - `gcp`: Map with "email" as a string and "privateKey"
                        as `bytes` or a base64 encoded string (unicode on Python 2).
                        Additionally, "endpoint" may also be specified as a string
                        (defaults to 'oauth2.googleapis.com'). These are the
                        credentials used to generate Google Cloud KMS messages.
                      - `local`: Map with "key" as `bytes` (96 bytes in length) or
                        a base64 encoded string (unicode on Python 2) which decodes
                        to 96 bytes. "key" is the master key used to encrypt/decrypt
                        data keys. This key should be generated and stored as securely
                        as possible.

                  - `key_vault_namespace`: The namespace for the key vault collection.
                    The key vault collection contains all data keys used for encryption
                    and decryption. Data keys are stored as documents in this MongoDB
                    collection. Data keys are protected with encryption by a KMS
                    provider.
                  - `key_vault_client`: A MongoClient connected to a MongoDB cluster
                    containing the `key_vault_namespace` collection.
                  - `codec_options`: An instance of
                    :class:`~bson.codec_options.CodecOptions` to use when encoding a
                    value for encryption and decoding the decrypted BSON value. This
                    should be the same CodecOptions instance configured on the
                    MongoClient, Database, or Collection used to access application
                    data.

                      - `keyVersion` (string): Optional. Version of the key to use.

                    If the `kms_provider` is "gcp" it is required and has the

                        Defaults to "cloudkms.googleapis.com".

                  - `key_alt_names` (optional): An optional list of string alternate
                    names used to reference a key. If a key is created with alternate
                    names, then encryption may refer to the key by the unique alternate
