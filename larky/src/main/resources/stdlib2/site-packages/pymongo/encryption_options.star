        Options to configure automatic client-side field level encryption.

                Automatic client-side field level encryption requires MongoDB 4.2
                enterprise or a MongoDB 4.2 Atlas cluster. Automatic encryption is not
                supported for operations on a database or view and will result in
                error.

                Although automatic encryption requires MongoDB 4.2 enterprise or a
                MongoDB 4.2 Atlas cluster, automatic *decryption* is supported for all
                users. To configure automatic *decryption* without automatic
                *encryption* set ``bypass_auto_encryption=True``. Explicit
                encryption and explicit decryption is also supported for all users
                with the :class:`~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption` class.

                See :ref:`automatic-client-side-encryption` for an example.

                :Parameters:
                  - `kms_providers`: Map of KMS provider options. Two KMS providers
                    are supported: "aws" and "local". The kmsProviders map values
                    differ by provider:

                      - `aws`: Map with "accessKeyId" and "secretAccessKey" as strings.
                        These are the AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key used
                        to generate KMS messages.
                      - `azure`: Map with "tenantId", "clientId", and "clientSecret" as
                        strings. Additionally, "identityPlatformEndpoint" may also be
                        specified as a string (defaults to 'login.microsoftonline.com').
                        These are the Azure Active Directory credentials used to
                        generate Azure Key Vault messages.
                      - `gcp`: Map with "email" as a string and "privateKey"
                        as `bytes` or a base64 encoded string (unicode on Python 2).
                        Additionally, "endpoint" may also be specified as a string
                        (defaults to 'oauth2.googleapis.com'). These are the
                        credentials used to generate Google Cloud KMS messages.
                      - `local`: Map with "key" as `bytes` (96 bytes in length) or
                        a base64 encoded string (unicode on Python 2) which decodes
                        to 96 bytes. "key" is the master key used to encrypt/decrypt
                        data keys. This key should be generated and stored as securely
                        as possible.

                  - `key_vault_namespace`: The namespace for the key vault collection.
                    The key vault collection contains all data keys used for encryption
                    and decryption. Data keys are stored as documents in this MongoDB
                    collection. Data keys are protected with encryption by a KMS
                    provider.
                  - `key_vault_client` (optional): By default the key vault collection
                    is assumed to reside in the same MongoDB cluster as the encrypted
                    MongoClient. Use this option to route data key queries to a
                    separate MongoDB cluster.
                  - `schema_map` (optional): Map of collection namespace ("db.coll") to
                    JSON Schema.  By default, a collection's JSONSchema is periodically
                    polled with the listCollections command. But a JSONSchema may be
                    specified locally with the schemaMap option.

                    **Supplying a `schema_map` provides more security than relying on
                    JSON Schemas obtained from the server. It protects against a
                    malicious server advertising a false JSON Schema, which could trick
                    the client into sending unencrypted data that should be
                    encrypted.**

                    Schemas supplied in the schemaMap only apply to configuring
                    automatic encryption for client side encryption. Other validation
                    rules in the JSON schema will not be enforced by the driver and
                    will result in an error.
                  - `bypass_auto_encryption` (optional): If ``True``, automatic
                    encryption will be disabled but automatic decryption will still be
                    enabled. Defaults to ``False``.
                  - `mongocryptd_uri` (optional): The MongoDB URI used to connect
                    to the *local* mongocryptd process. Defaults to
                    ``'mongodb://localhost:27020'``.
                  - `mongocryptd_bypass_spawn` (optional): If ``True``, the encrypted
                    MongoClient will not attempt to spawn the mongocryptd process.
                    Defaults to ``False``.
                  - `mongocryptd_spawn_path` (optional): Used for spawning the
                    mongocryptd process. Defaults to ``'mongocryptd'`` and spawns
                    mongocryptd from the system path.
                  - `mongocryptd_spawn_args` (optional): A list of string arguments to
                    use when spawning the mongocryptd process. Defaults to
                    ``['--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60']``. If the list does not include
                    the ``idleShutdownTimeoutSecs`` option then
                    ``'--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60'`` will be added.
