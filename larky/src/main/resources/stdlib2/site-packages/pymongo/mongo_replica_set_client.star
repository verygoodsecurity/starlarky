    Deprecated alias for :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`.

        :class:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient`
        will be removed in a future version of PyMongo.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.0
           :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` is now the one and only
           client class for a standalone server, mongos, or replica set.
           It includes the functionality that had been split into
           :class:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient`: it
           can connect to a replica set, discover all its members, and monitor
           the set for stepdowns, elections, and reconfigs.

           The ``refresh`` method is removed from
           :class:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient`,
           as are the ``seeds`` and ``hosts`` properties.
