        Client for a MongoDB instance, a replica set, or a set of mongoses.

                The client object is thread-safe and has connection-pooling built in.
                If an operation fails because of a network error,
                :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` is raised and the client
                reconnects in the background. Application code should handle this
                exception (recognizing that the operation failed) and then continue to
                execute.

                The `host` parameter can be a full `mongodb URI
                <http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/connections>`_, in addition to
                a simple hostname. It can also be a list of hostnames or
                URIs. Any port specified in the host string(s) will override
                the `port` parameter. If multiple mongodb URIs containing
                database or auth information are passed, the last database,
                username, and password present will be used.  For username and
                passwords reserved characters like ':', '/', '+' and '@' must be
                percent encoded following RFC 2396::

                    try:
                        # Python 3.x
                        from urllib.parse import quote_plus
                    except ImportError:
                        # Python 2.x
                        from urllib import quote_plus

                    uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (
                        quote_plus(user), quote_plus(password), host)
                    client = MongoClient(uri)

                Unix domain sockets are also supported. The socket path must be percent
                encoded in the URI::

                    uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (
                        quote_plus(user), quote_plus(password), quote_plus(socket_path))
                    client = MongoClient(uri)

                But not when passed as a simple hostname::

                    client = MongoClient('/tmp/mongodb-27017.sock')

                Starting with version 3.6, PyMongo supports mongodb+srv:// URIs. The
                URI must include one, and only one, hostname. The hostname will be
                resolved to one or more DNS `SRV records
                <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record>`_ which will be used
                as the seed list for connecting to the MongoDB deployment. When using
                SRV URIs, the `authSource` and `replicaSet` configuration options can
                be specified using `TXT records
                <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record>`_. See the
                `Initial DNS Seedlist Discovery spec
                <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/
                initial-dns-seedlist-discovery/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery.rst>`_
                for more details. Note that the use of SRV URIs implicitly enables
                TLS support. Pass tls=false in the URI to override.

                .. note:: MongoClient creation will block waiting for answers from
                  DNS when mongodb+srv:// URIs are used.

                .. note:: Starting with version 3.0 the :class:`MongoClient`
                  constructor no longer blocks while connecting to the server or
                  servers, and it no longer raises
                  :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` if they are
                  unavailable, nor :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError`
                  if the user's credentials are wrong. Instead, the constructor
                  returns immediately and launches the connection process on
                  background threads. You can check if the server is available
                  like this::

                    from pymongo.errors import ConnectionFailure
                    client = MongoClient()
                    try:
                        # The ismaster command is cheap and does not require auth.
                        client.admin.command('ismaster')
                    except ConnectionFailure:
                        print("Server not available")

                .. warning:: When using PyMongo in a multiprocessing context, please
                  read :ref:`multiprocessing` first.

                .. note:: Many of the following options can be passed using a MongoDB
                  URI or keyword parameters. If the same option is passed in a URI and
                  as a keyword parameter the keyword parameter takes precedence.

                :Parameters:
                  - `host` (optional): hostname or IP address or Unix domain socket
                    path of a single mongod or mongos instance to connect to, or a
                    mongodb URI, or a list of hostnames / mongodb URIs. If `host` is
                    an IPv6 literal it must be enclosed in '[' and ']' characters
                    following the RFC2732 URL syntax (e.g. '[::1]' for localhost).
                    Multihomed and round robin DNS addresses are **not** supported.
                  - `port` (optional): port number on which to connect
                  - `document_class` (optional): default class to use for
                    documents returned from queries on this client
                  - `type_registry` (optional): instance of
                    :class:`~bson.codec_options.TypeRegistry` to enable encoding
                    and decoding of custom types.
                  - `tz_aware` (optional): if ``True``,
                    :class:`~datetime.datetime` instances returned as values
                    in a document by this :class:`MongoClient` will be timezone
                    aware (otherwise they will be naive)
                  - `connect` (optional): if ``True`` (the default), immediately
                    begin connecting to MongoDB in the background. Otherwise connect
                    on the first operation.
                  - `directConnection` (optional): if ``True``, forces this client to
                     connect directly to the specified MongoDB host as a standalone.
                     If ``false``, the client connects to the entire replica set of
                     which the given MongoDB host(s) is a part. If this is ``True``
                     and a mongodb+srv:// URI or a URI containing multiple seeds is
                     provided, an exception will be raised.

                  | **Other optional parameters can be passed as keyword arguments:**

                  - `maxPoolSize` (optional): The maximum allowable number of
                    concurrent connections to each connected server. Requests to a
                    server will block if there are `maxPoolSize` outstanding
                    connections to the requested server. Defaults to 100. Cannot be 0.
                  - `minPoolSize` (optional): The minimum required number of concurrent
                    connections that the pool will maintain to each connected server.
                    Default is 0.
                  - `maxIdleTimeMS` (optional): The maximum number of milliseconds that
                    a connection can remain idle in the pool before being removed and
                    replaced. Defaults to `None` (no limit).
                  - `socketTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) Controls how long (in
                    milliseconds) the driver will wait for a response after sending an
                    ordinary (non-monitoring) database operation before concluding that
                    a network error has occurred. ``0`` or ``None`` means no timeout.
                    Defaults to ``None`` (no timeout).
                  - `connectTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) Controls how long (in
                    milliseconds) the driver will wait during server monitoring when
                    connecting a new socket to a server before concluding the server
                    is unavailable. ``0`` or ``None`` means no timeout.
                    Defaults to ``20000`` (20 seconds).
                  - `server_selector`: (callable or None) Optional, user-provided
                    function that augments server selection rules. The function should
                    accept as an argument a list of
                    :class:`~pymongo.server_description.ServerDescription` objects and
                    return a list of server descriptions that should be considered
                    suitable for the desired operation.
                  - `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`: (integer) Controls how long (in
                    milliseconds) the driver will wait to find an available,
                    appropriate server to carry out a database operation; while it is
                    waiting, multiple server monitoring operations may be carried out,
                    each controlled by `connectTimeoutMS`. Defaults to ``30000`` (30
                    seconds).
                  - `waitQueueTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) How long (in milliseconds)
                    a thread will wait for a socket from the pool if the pool has no
                    free sockets. Defaults to ``None`` (no timeout).
                  - `waitQueueMultiple`: (integer or None) Multiplied by maxPoolSize
                    to give the number of threads allowed to wait for a socket at one
                    time. Defaults to ``None`` (no limit).
                  - `heartbeatFrequencyMS`: (optional) The number of milliseconds
                    between periodic server checks, or None to accept the default
                    frequency of 10 seconds.
                  - `appname`: (string or None) The name of the application that
                    created this MongoClient instance. MongoDB 3.4 and newer will
                    print this value in the server log upon establishing each
                    connection. It is also recorded in the slow query log and
                    profile collections.
                  - `driver`: (pair or None) A driver implemented on top of PyMongo can
                    pass a :class:`~pymongo.driver_info.DriverInfo` to add its name,
                    version, and platform to the message printed in the server log when
                    establishing a connection.
                  - `event_listeners`: a list or tuple of event listeners. See
                    :mod:`~pymongo.monitoring` for details.
                  - `retryWrites`: (boolean) Whether supported write operations
                    executed within this MongoClient will be retried once after a
                    network error on MongoDB 3.6+. Defaults to ``True``.
                    The supported write operations are:

                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.bulk_write`, as long as
                        :class:`~pymongo.operations.UpdateMany` or
                        :class:`~pymongo.operations.DeleteMany` are not included.
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.delete_one`
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_one`
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_many`
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.replace_one`
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.update_one`
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_delete`
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_replace`
                      - :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one_and_update`

                    Unsupported write operations include, but are not limited to,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.aggregate` using the ``$out``
                    pipeline operator and any operation with an unacknowledged write
                    concern (e.g. {w: 0})). See
                    https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/retryable-writes/retryable-writes.rst
                  - `retryReads`: (boolean) Whether supported read operations
                    executed within this MongoClient will be retried once after a
                    network error on MongoDB 3.6+. Defaults to ``True``.
                    The supported read operations are:
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.aggregate` without ``$out``,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.distinct`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.count`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.estimated_document_count`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.count_documents`,
                    :meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.watch`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.list_indexes`,
                    :meth:`pymongo.database.Database.watch`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.list_collections`,
                    :meth:`pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.watch`,
                    and :meth:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient.list_databases`.

                    Unsupported read operations include, but are not limited to:
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.map_reduce`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.inline_map_reduce`,
                    :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.command`,
                    and any getMore operation on a cursor.

                    Enabling retryable reads makes applications more resilient to
                    transient errors such as network failures, database upgrades, and
                    replica set failovers. For an exact definition of which errors
                    trigger a retry, see the `retryable reads specification
                    <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/retryable-reads/retryable-reads.rst>`_.

                  - `socketKeepAlive`: (boolean) **DEPRECATED** Whether to send
                    periodic keep-alive packets on connected sockets. Defaults to
                    ``True``. Disabling it is not recommended, see
                    https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/faq/diagnostics/#does-tcp-keepalive-time-affect-mongodb-deployments",
                  - `compressors`: Comma separated list of compressors for wire
                    protocol compression. The list is used to negotiate a compressor
                    with the server. Currently supported options are "snappy", "zlib"
                    and "zstd". Support for snappy requires the
                    `python-snappy <https://pypi.org/project/python-snappy/>`_ package.
                    zlib support requires the Python standard library zlib module. zstd
                    requires the `zstandard <https://pypi.org/project/zstandard/>`_
                    package. By default no compression is used. Compression support
                    must also be enabled on the server. MongoDB 3.4+ supports snappy
                    compression. MongoDB 3.6 adds support for zlib. MongoDB 4.2 adds
                    support for zstd.
                  - `zlibCompressionLevel`: (int) The zlib compression level to use
                    when zlib is used as the wire protocol compressor. Supported values
                    are -1 through 9. -1 tells the zlib library to use its default
                    compression level (usually 6). 0 means no compression. 1 is best
                    speed. 9 is best compression. Defaults to -1.
                  - `uuidRepresentation`: The BSON representation to use when encoding
                    from and decoding to instances of :class:`~uuid.UUID`. Valid
                    values are `pythonLegacy` (the default), `javaLegacy`,
                    `csharpLegacy`, `standard` and `unspecified`. New applications
                    should consider setting this to `standard` for cross language
                    compatibility. See :ref:`handling-uuid-data-example` for details.

                  | **Write Concern options:**
                  | (Only set if passed. No default values.)

                  - `w`: (integer or string) If this is a replica set, write operations
                    will block until they have been replicated to the specified number
                    or tagged set of servers. `w=<int>` always includes the replica set
                    primary (e.g. w=3 means write to the primary and wait until
                    replicated to **two** secondaries). Passing w=0 **disables write
                    acknowledgement** and all other write concern options.
                  - `wTimeoutMS`: (integer) Used in conjunction with `w`. Specify a value
                    in milliseconds to control how long to wait for write propagation
                    to complete. If replication does not complete in the given
                    timeframe, a timeout exception is raised. Passing wTimeoutMS=0
                    will cause **write operations to wait indefinitely**.
                  - `journal`: If ``True`` block until write operations have been
                    committed to the journal. Cannot be used in combination with
                    `fsync`. Prior to MongoDB 2.6 this option was ignored if the server
                    was running without journaling. Starting with MongoDB 2.6 write
                    operations will fail with an exception if this option is used when
                    the server is running without journaling.
                  - `fsync`: If ``True`` and the server is running without journaling,
                    blocks until the server has synced all data files to disk. If the
                    server is running with journaling, this acts the same as the `j`
                    option, blocking until write operations have been committed to the
                    journal. Cannot be used in combination with `j`.

                  | **Replica set keyword arguments for connecting with a replica set
                    - either directly or via a mongos:**

                  - `replicaSet`: (string or None) The name of the replica set to
                    connect to. The driver will verify that all servers it connects to
                    match this name. Implies that the hosts specified are a seed list
                    and the driver should attempt to find all members of the set.
                    Defaults to ``None``.

                  | **Read Preference:**

                  - `readPreference`: The replica set read preference for this client.
                    One of ``primary``, ``primaryPreferred``, ``secondary``,
                    ``secondaryPreferred``, or ``nearest``. Defaults to ``primary``.
                  - `readPreferenceTags`: Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list
                    of colon-separated key-value pairs. For example ``dc:ny,rack:1``.
                    Defaults to ``None``.
                  - `maxStalenessSeconds`: (integer) The maximum estimated
                    length of time a replica set secondary can fall behind the primary
                    in replication before it will no longer be selected for operations.
                    Defaults to ``-1``, meaning no maximum. If maxStalenessSeconds
                    is set, it must be a positive integer greater than or equal to
                    90 seconds.

                  .. seealso:: :doc:`/examples/server_selection`

                  | **Authentication:**

                  - `username`: A string.
                  - `password`: A string.

                    Although username and password must be percent-escaped in a MongoDB
                    URI, they must not be percent-escaped when passed as parameters. In
                    this example, both the space and slash special characters are passed
                    as-is::

                      MongoClient(username="user name", password="pass/word")

                  - `authSource`: The database to authenticate on. Defaults to the
                    database specified in the URI, if provided, or to "admin".
                  - `authMechanism`: See :data:`~pymongo.auth.MECHANISMS` for options.
                    If no mechanism is specified, PyMongo automatically uses MONGODB-CR
                    when connected to a pre-3.0 version of MongoDB, SCRAM-SHA-1 when
                    connected to MongoDB 3.0 through 3.6, and negotiates the mechanism
                    to use (SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256) when connected to MongoDB
                    4.0+.
                  - `authMechanismProperties`: Used to specify authentication mechanism
                    specific options. To specify the service name for GSSAPI
                    authentication pass authMechanismProperties='SERVICE_NAME:<service
                    name>'.
                    To specify the session token for MONGODB-AWS authentication pass
                    ``authMechanismProperties='AWS_SESSION_TOKEN:<session token>'``.

                  .. seealso:: :doc:`/examples/authentication`

                  | **TLS/SSL configuration:**

                  - `tls`: (boolean) If ``True``, create the connection to the server
                    using transport layer security. Defaults to ``False``.
                  - `tlsInsecure`: (boolean) Specify whether TLS constraints should be
                    relaxed as much as possible. Setting ``tlsInsecure=True`` implies
                    ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=True`` and
                    ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames=True``. Defaults to ``False``. Think
                    very carefully before setting this to ``True`` as it dramatically
                    reduces the security of TLS.
                  - `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`: (boolean) If ``True``, continues
                    the TLS handshake regardless of the outcome of the certificate
                    verification process. If this is ``False``, and a value is not
                    provided for ``tlsCAFile``, PyMongo will attempt to load system
                    provided CA certificates. If the python version in use does not
                    support loading system CA certificates then the ``tlsCAFile``
                    parameter must point to a file of CA certificates.
                    ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=False`` implies ``tls=True``.
                    Defaults to ``False``. Think very carefully before setting this
                    to ``True`` as that could make your application vulnerable to
                    man-in-the-middle attacks.
                  - `tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`: (boolean) If ``True``, disables TLS
                    hostname verification. ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames=False`` implies
                    ``tls=True``. Defaults to ``False``. Think very carefully before
                    setting this to ``True`` as that could make your application
                    vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
                  - `tlsCAFile`: A file containing a single or a bundle of
                    "certification authority" certificates, which are used to validate
                    certificates passed from the other end of the connection.
                    Implies ``tls=True``. Defaults to ``None``.
                  - `tlsCertificateKeyFile`: A file containing the client certificate
                    and private key. If you want to pass the certificate and private
                    key as separate files, use the ``ssl_certfile`` and ``ssl_keyfile``
                    options instead. Implies ``tls=True``. Defaults to ``None``.
                  - `tlsCRLFile`: A file containing a PEM or DER formatted
                    certificate revocation list. Only supported by python 2.7.9+
                    (pypy 2.5.1+). Implies ``tls=True``. Defaults to ``None``.
                  - `tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword`: The password or passphrase for
                    decrypting the private key in ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` or
                    ``ssl_keyfile``. Only necessary if the private key is encrypted.
                    Only supported by python 2.7.9+ (pypy 2.5.1+) and 3.3+. Defaults
                    to ``None``.
                  - `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`: (boolean) If ``True``, disables
                    certificate revocation status checking via the OCSP responder
                    specified on the server certificate. Defaults to ``False``.
                  - `ssl`: (boolean) Alias for ``tls``.
                  - `ssl_certfile`: The certificate file used to identify the local
                    connection against mongod. Implies ``tls=True``. Defaults to
                    ``None``.
                  - `ssl_keyfile`: The private keyfile used to identify the local
                    connection against mongod. Can be omitted if the keyfile is
                    included with the ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``. Implies ``tls=True``.
                    Defaults to ``None``.

                  | **Read Concern options:**
                  | (If not set explicitly, this will use the server default)

                  - `readConcernLevel`: (string) The read concern level specifies the
                    level of isolation for read operations.  For example, a read
                    operation using a read concern level of ``majority`` will only
                    return data that has been written to a majority of nodes. If the
                    level is left unspecified, the server default will be used.

                  | **Client side encryption options:**
                  | (If not set explicitly, client side encryption will not be enabled.)

                  - `auto_encryption_opts`: A
                    :class:`~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts` which
                    configures this client to automatically encrypt collection commands
                    and automatically decrypt results. See
                    :ref:`automatic-client-side-encryption` for an example.

                   ``socketKeepAlive`` now defaults to ``True``.

                .. versionchanged:: 3.0
                   :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` is now the one and only
                   client class for a standalone server, mongos, or replica set.
                   It includes the functionality that had been split into
                   :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoReplicaSetClient`: it can connect
                   to a replica set, discover all its members, and monitor the set for
                   stepdowns, elections, and reconfigs.

                   The :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` constructor no
                   longer blocks while connecting to the server or servers, and it no
                   longer raises :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` if they
                   are unavailable, nor :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError`
                   if the user's credentials are wrong. Instead, the constructor
                   returns immediately and launches the connection process on
                   background threads.

                   Therefore the ``alive`` method is removed since it no longer
                   provides meaningful information; even if the client is disconnected,
                   it may discover a server in time to fulfill the next operation.

                   In PyMongo 2.x, :class:`~pymongo.MongoClient` accepted a list of
                   standalone MongoDB servers and used the first it could connect to::

                       MongoClient(['host1.com:27017', 'host2.com:27017'])

                   A list of multiple standalones is no longer supported; if multiple
                   servers are listed they must be members of the same replica set, or
                   mongoses in the same sharded cluster.

                   The behavior for a list of mongoses is changed from "high
                   availability" to "load balancing". Before, the client connected to
                   the lowest-latency mongos in the list, and used it until a network
                   error prompted it to re-evaluate all mongoses' latencies and
                   reconnect to one of them. In PyMongo 3, the client monitors its
                   network latency to all the mongoses continuously, and distributes
                   operations evenly among those with the lowest latency. See
                   :ref:`mongos-load-balancing` for more information.

                   The ``connect`` option is added.

                   The ``start_request``, ``in_request``, and ``end_request`` methods
                   are removed, as well as the ``auto_start_request`` option.

                   The ``copy_database`` method is removed, see the
                   :doc:`copy_database examples </examples/copydb>` for alternatives.

                   The :meth:`MongoClient.disconnect` method is removed; it was a
                   synonym for :meth:`~pymongo.MongoClient.close`.

                   :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` no longer returns an
                   instance of :class:`~pymongo.database.Database` for attribute names
                   with leading underscores. You must use dict-style lookups instead::

                  - `pipeline` (optional): A list of aggregation pipeline stages to
                    append to an initial ``$changeStream`` stage. Not all
                    pipeline stages are valid after a ``$changeStream`` stage, see the
                    MongoDB documentation on change streams for the supported stages.

                    to the ``$changeStream`` stage. Allowed values: 'updateLookup'.
                    When set to 'updateLookup', the change notification for partial
                    updates will include both a delta describing the changes to the
                    document, as well as a copy of the entire document that was
                    changed from some time after the change occurred.
                  - `resume_after` (optional): A resume token. If provided, the
                    change stream will start returning changes that occur directly
                    after the operation specified in the resume token. A resume token
                    is the _id value of a change document.
                  - `max_await_time_ms` (optional): The maximum time in milliseconds
                    for the server to wait for changes before responding to a getMore
                    operation.
                  - `batch_size` (optional): The maximum number of documents to return
                    per batch.
                  - `collation` (optional): The :class:`~pymongo.collation.Collation`
                    to use for the aggregation.
                  - `start_at_operation_time` (optional): If provided, the resulting
                    change stream will only return changes that occurred at or after
                    the specified :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp`. Requires
                    MongoDB >= 4.0.
                  - `session` (optional): a
                    :class:`~pymongo.client_session.ClientSession`.
                  - `start_after` (optional): The same as `resume_after` except that
                    `start_after` can resume notifications after an invalidate event.
                    This option and `resume_after` are mutually exclusive.
