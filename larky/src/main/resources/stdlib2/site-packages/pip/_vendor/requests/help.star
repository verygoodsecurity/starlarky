def _implementation():
    """
    Return a dict with the Python implementation and version.

        Provide both the name and the version of the Python implementation
        currently running. For example, on CPython 2.7.5 it will return
        {'name': 'CPython', 'version': '2.7.5'}.

        This function works best on CPython and PyPy: in particular, it probably
        doesn't work for Jython or IronPython. Future investigation should be done
        to work out the correct shape of the code for those platforms.
