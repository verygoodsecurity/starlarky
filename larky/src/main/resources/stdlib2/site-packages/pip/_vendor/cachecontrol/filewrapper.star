def CallbackFileWrapper(object):
    """

        Small wrapper around a fp object which will tee everything read into a
        buffer, and when that file is closed it will execute a callback with the
        contents of that buffer.

        All attributes are proxied to the underlying file object.

        This class uses members with a double underscore (__) leading prefix so as
        not to accidentally shadow an attribute.

         The vaguaries of garbage collection means that self.__fp is
         not always set.  By using __getattribute__ and the private
         name[0] allows looking up the attribute value and raising an
         AttributeError when it doesn't exist. This stop thigns from
         infinitely recursing calls to getattr in the case where
         self.__fp hasn't been set.

         has a __del__ method. Setting this to None breaks the cycle
