        '''This is the constructor. The command parameter may be a string that
                includes a command and any arguments to the command. For example::

                    child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ftp')
                    child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ssh user@example.com')
                    child = pexpect.spawn('ls -latr /tmp')

                You may also construct it with a list of arguments like so::

                    child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ftp', [])
                    child = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ssh', ['user@example.com'])
                    child = pexpect.spawn('ls', ['-latr', '/tmp'])

                After this the child application will be created and will be ready to
                talk to. For normal use, see expect() and send() and sendline().

                Remember that Pexpect does NOT interpret shell meta characters such as
                redirect, pipe, or wild cards (``>``, ``|``, or ``*``). This is a
                common mistake.  If you want to run a command and pipe it through
                another command then you must also start a shell. For example::

                    child = pexpect.spawn('/bin/bash -c "ls -l | grep LOG > logs.txt"')
                    child.expect(pexpect.EOF)

                The second form of spawn (where you pass a list of arguments) is useful
                in situations where you wish to spawn a command and pass it its own
                argument list. This can make syntax more clear. For example, the
                following is equivalent to the previous example::

                    shell_cmd = 'ls -l | grep LOG > logs.txt'
                    child = pexpect.spawn('/bin/bash', ['-c', shell_cmd])
                    child.expect(pexpect.EOF)

                The maxread attribute sets the read buffer size. This is maximum number
                of bytes that Pexpect will try to read from a TTY at one time. Setting
                the maxread size to 1 will turn off buffering. Setting the maxread
                value higher may help performance in cases where large amounts of
                output are read back from the child. This feature is useful in
                conjunction with searchwindowsize.

                When the keyword argument *searchwindowsize* is None (default), the
                full buffer is searched at each iteration of receiving incoming data.
                The default number of bytes scanned at each iteration is very large
                and may be reduced to collaterally reduce search cost.  After
                :meth:`~.expect` returns, the full buffer attribute remains up to
                size *maxread* irrespective of *searchwindowsize* value.

                When the keyword argument ``timeout`` is specified as a number,
                (default: *30*), then :class:`TIMEOUT` will be raised after the value
                specified has elapsed, in seconds, for any of the :meth:`~.expect`
                family of method calls.  When None, TIMEOUT will not be raised, and
                :meth:`~.expect` may block indefinitely until match.


                The logfile member turns on or off logging. All input and output will
                be copied to the given file object. Set logfile to None to stop
                logging. This is the default. Set logfile to sys.stdout to echo
                everything to standard output. The logfile is flushed after each write.

                Example log input and output to a file::

                    child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
                    fout = open('mylog.txt','wb')
                    child.logfile = fout

                Example log to stdout::

                    # In Python 2:
                    child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
                    child.logfile = sys.stdout

                    # In Python 3, we'll use the ``encoding`` argument to decode data
                    # from the subprocess and handle it as unicode:
                    child = pexpect.spawn('some_command', encoding='utf-8')
                    child.logfile = sys.stdout

                The logfile_read and logfile_send members can be used to separately log
                the input from the child and output sent to the child. Sometimes you
                don't want to see everything you write to the child. You only want to
                log what the child sends back. For example::

                    child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
                    child.logfile_read = sys.stdout

                You will need to pass an encoding to spawn in the above code if you are
                using Python 3.

                To separately log output sent to the child use logfile_send::

                    child.logfile_send = fout

                If ``ignore_sighup`` is True, the child process will ignore SIGHUP
                signals. The default is False from Pexpect 4.0, meaning that SIGHUP
                will be handled normally by the child.

                The delaybeforesend helps overcome a weird behavior that many users
                were experiencing. The typical problem was that a user would expect() a
                "Password:" prompt and then immediately call sendline() to send the
                password. The user would then see that their password was echoed back
                to them. Passwords don't normally echo. The problem is caused by the
                fact that most applications print out the "Password" prompt and then
                turn off stdin echo, but if you send your password before the
                application turned off echo, then you get your password echoed.
                Normally this wouldn't be a problem when interacting with a human at a
                real keyboard. If you introduce a slight delay just before writing then
                this seems to clear up the problem. This was such a common problem for
                many users that I decided that the default pexpect behavior should be
                to sleep just before writing to the child application. 1/20th of a
                second (50 ms) seems to be enough to clear up the problem. You can set
                delaybeforesend to None to return to the old behavior.

                Note that spawn is clever about finding commands on your path.
                It uses the same logic that "which" uses to find executables.

                If you wish to get the exit status of the child you must call the
                close() method. The exit or signal status of the child will be stored
                in self.exitstatus or self.signalstatus. If the child exited normally
                then exitstatus will store the exit return code and signalstatus will
                be None. If the child was terminated abnormally with a signal then
                signalstatus will store the signal value and exitstatus will be None::

                    child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
                    child.close()
                    print(child.exitstatus, child.signalstatus)

                If you need more detail you can also read the self.status member which
                stores the status returned by os.waitpid. You can interpret this using
                os.WIFEXITED/os.WEXITSTATUS or os.WIFSIGNALED/os.TERMSIG.

                The echo attribute may be set to False to disable echoing of input.
                As a pseudo-terminal, all input echoed by the "keyboard" (send()
                or sendline()) will be repeated to output.  For many cases, it is
                not desirable to have echo enabled, and it may be later disabled
                using setecho(False) followed by waitnoecho().  However, for some
                platforms such as Solaris, this is not possible, and should be
                disabled immediately on spawn.

                If preexec_fn is given, it will be called in the child process before
                launching the given command. This is useful to e.g. reset inherited
                signal handlers.

                The dimensions attribute specifies the size of the pseudo-terminal as
                seen by the subprocess, and is specified as a two-entry tuple (rows,
                columns). If this is unspecified, the defaults in ptyprocess will apply.

                The use_poll attribute enables using select.poll() over select.select()
                for socket handling. This is handy if your system could have > 1024 fds

                the stdout and stderr output of the child process is printed. This
                simply echos the child stdout and child stderr to the real stdout and
                it echos the real stdin to the child stdin. When the user types the
                escape_character this method will return None. The escape_character
                will not be transmitted.  The default for escape_character is

                escaping, escape_character may be set to None.

                If a logfile is specified, then the data sent and received from the
                child process in interact mode is duplicated to the given log.

                You may pass in optional input and output filter functions. These
                functions should take bytes array and return bytes array too. Even
                with ``encoding='utf-8'`` support, meth:`interact` will always pass
                input_filter and output_filter bytes. You may need to wrap your
                function to decode and encode back to UTF-8.

                The output_filter will be passed all the output from the child process.
                The input_filter will be passed all the keyboard input from the user.
                The input_filter is run BEFORE the check for the escape_character.

                Note that if you change the window size of the parent the SIGWINCH
                signal will not be passed through to the child. If you want the child
                window size to change when the parent's window size changes then do
