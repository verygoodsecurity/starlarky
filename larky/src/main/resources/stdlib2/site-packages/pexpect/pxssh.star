    '''This class extends pexpect.spawn to specialize setting up SSH
        connections. This adds methods for login, logout, and expecting the shell
        prompt. It does various tricky things to handle many situations in the SSH
        login process. For example, if the session is your first login, then pxssh
        automatically accepts the remote certificate; or if you have public key
        authentication setup then pxssh won't wait for the password prompt.

        pxssh uses the shell prompt to synchronize output from the remote host. In
        order to make this more robust it sets the shell prompt to something more
        unique than just $ or #. This should work on most Borne/Bash or Csh style
        shells.

        Example that runs a few commands on a remote server and prints the result::

            from pexpect import pxssh
            import getpass
            try:
                s = pxssh.pxssh()
                hostname = raw_input('hostname: ')
                username = raw_input('username: ')
                password = getpass.getpass('password: ')
                s.login(hostname, username, password)
                s.sendline('uptime')   # run a command
                s.prompt()             # match the prompt
                print(s.before)        # print everything before the prompt.
                s.sendline('ls -l')
                s.prompt()
                print(s.before)
                s.sendline('df')
                s.prompt()
                print(s.before)
                s.logout()
            except pxssh.ExceptionPxssh as e:
                print("pxssh failed on login.")
                print(e)

        Example showing how to specify SSH options::

            from pexpect import pxssh
            s = pxssh.pxssh(options={
                                "StrictHostKeyChecking": "no",
                                "UserKnownHostsFile": "/dev/null"})
            ...

        Note that if you have ssh-agent running while doing development with pxssh
        then this can lead to a lot of confusion. Many X display managers (xdm,
        gdm, kdm, etc.) will automatically start a GUI agent. You may see a GUI
        dialog box popup asking for a password during development. You should turn
        off any key agents during testing. The 'force_password' attribute will turn
        off public key authentication. This will only work if the remote SSH server
        is configured to allow password logins. Example of using 'force_password'
        attribute::

                s = pxssh.pxssh()
                s.force_password = True
                hostname = raw_input('hostname: ')
                username = raw_input('username: ')
                password = getpass.getpass('password: ')
                s.login (hostname, username, password)

        `debug_command_string` is only for the test suite to confirm that the string
        generated for SSH is correct, using this will not allow you to do
        anything other than get a string back from `pxssh.pxssh.login()`.

        '''This logs the user into the given server.

                It uses 'original_prompt' to try to find the prompt right after login.
                When it finds the prompt it immediately tries to reset the prompt to
                something more easily matched. The default 'original_prompt' is very
                optimistic and is easily fooled. It's more reliable to try to match the original
                prompt as exactly as possible to prevent false matches by server
                strings such as the "Message Of The Day". On many systems you can
                disable the MOTD on the remote server by creating a zero-length file
                called :file:`~/.hushlogin` on the remote server. If a prompt cannot be found
                then this will not necessarily cause the login to fail. In the case of
                a timeout when looking for the prompt we assume that the original
                prompt was so weird that we could not match it, so we use a few tricks
                to guess when we have reached the prompt. Then we hope for the best and
                blindly try to reset the prompt to something more unique. If that fails
                then login() raises an :class:`ExceptionPxssh` exception.

                In some situations it is not possible or desirable to reset the
                original prompt. In this case, pass ``auto_prompt_reset=False`` to
                inhibit setting the prompt to the UNIQUE_PROMPT. Remember that pxssh
                uses a unique prompt in the :meth:`prompt` method. If the original prompt is
                not reset then this will disable the :meth:`prompt` method unless you
                manually set the :attr:`PROMPT` attribute.

                Set ``password_regex`` if there is a MOTD message with `password` in it.
                Changing this is like playing in traffic, don't (p)expect it to match straight
                away.

                If you require to connect to another SSH server from the your original SSH
                connection set ``spawn_local_ssh`` to `False` and this will use your current
                session to do so. Setting this option to `False` and not having an active session
                will trigger an error.

                Set ``ssh_key`` to a file path to an SSH private key to use that SSH key
                for the session authentication.
                Set ``ssh_key`` to `True` to force passing the current SSH authentication socket
                to the desired ``hostname``.

                Set ``ssh_config`` to a file path string of an SSH client config file to pass that
                file to the client to handle itself. You may set any options you wish in here, however
                doing so will require you to post extra information that you may not want to if you
                run into issues.

                Alter the ``cmd`` to change the ssh client used, or to prepend it with network
                namespaces. For example ```cmd="ip netns exec vlan2 ssh"``` to execute the ssh in
                network namespace named ```vlan```.

                method, but you may want to call it manually if you somehow reset the
                shell prompt. For example, if you 'su' to a different user then you
                will need to manually reset the prompt. This sends shell commands to
                the remote host to set the prompt, so this assumes the remote host is

                Alternatively, you may use your own prompt pattern. In this case you

                :attr:`PROMPT` attribute to a regular expression. After that, the
