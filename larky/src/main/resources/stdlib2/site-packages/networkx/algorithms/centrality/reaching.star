def _average_weight(G, path, weight=None):
    """
    Returns the average weight of an edge in a weighted path.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A networkx graph.

        path: list
          A list of vertices that define the path.

        weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
          If None, edge weights are ignored.  Then the average weight of an edge
          is assumed to be the multiplicative inverse of the length of the path.
          Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

def global_reaching_centrality(G, weight=None, normalized=True):
    """
    Returns the global reaching centrality of a directed graph.

        The *global reaching centrality* of a weighted directed graph is the
        average over all nodes of the difference between the local reaching
        centrality of the node and the greatest local reaching centrality of
        any node in the graph [1]_. For more information on the local
        reaching centrality, see :func:`local_reaching_centrality`.
        Informally, the local reaching centrality is the proportion of the
        graph that is reachable from the neighbors of the node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : DiGraph
            A networkx DiGraph.

        weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
            Attribute to use for edge weights. If ``None``, each edge weight
            is assumed to be one. A higher weight implies a stronger
            connection between nodes and a *shorter* path length.

        normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
            Whether to normalize the edge weights by the total sum of edge
            weights.

        Returns
        -------
        h : float
            The global reaching centrality of the graph.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 3)
        >>> nx.global_reaching_centrality(G)
        1.0
        >>> G.add_edge(3, 2)
        >>> nx.global_reaching_centrality(G)
        0.75

    Returns the local reaching centrality of a node in a directed
        graph.

        The *local reaching centrality* of a node in a directed graph is the
        proportion of other nodes reachable from that node [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : DiGraph
            A NetworkX DiGraph.

        v : node
            A node in the directed graph `G`.

        paths : dictionary (default=None)
            If this is not `None` it must be a dictionary representation
            of single-source shortest paths, as computed by, for example,
            :func:`networkx.shortest_path` with source node `v`. Use this
            keyword argument if you intend to invoke this function many
            times but don't want the paths to be recomputed each time.

        weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
            Attribute to use for edge weights.  If `None`, each edge weight
            is assumed to be one. A higher weight implies a stronger
            connection between nodes and a *shorter* path length.

        normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
            Whether to normalize the edge weights by the total sum of edge
            weights.

        Returns
        -------
        h : float
            The local reaching centrality of the node ``v`` in the graph
            ``G``.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
        >>> nx.local_reaching_centrality(G, 3)
        0.0
        >>> G.add_edge(3, 2)
        >>> nx.local_reaching_centrality(G, 3)
