def local_node_connectivity(
    G, s, t, flow_func=None, auxiliary=None, residual=None, cutoff=None
):
    """
    r"""Computes local node connectivity for nodes s and t.

        Local node connectivity for two non adjacent nodes s and t is the
        minimum number of nodes that must be removed (along with their incident
        edges) to disconnect them.

        This is a flow based implementation of node connectivity. We compute the
        maximum flow on an auxiliary digraph build from the original input
        graph (see below for details).

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        s : node
            Source node

        t : node
            Target node

        flow_func : function
            A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
            The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph,
            a source node, and a target node. And return a residual network
            that follows NetworkX conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for
            details). If flow_func is None, the default maximum flow function
            (:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. See below for details. The choice
            of the default function may change from version to version and
            should not be relied on. Default value: None.

        auxiliary : NetworkX DiGraph
            Auxiliary digraph to compute flow based node connectivity. It has
            to have a graph attribute called mapping with a dictionary mapping
            node names in G and in the auxiliary digraph. If provided
            it will be reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

        residual : NetworkX DiGraph
            Residual network to compute maximum flow. If provided it will be
            reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

        cutoff : integer, float
            If specified, the maximum flow algorithm will terminate when the
            flow value reaches or exceeds the cutoff. This is only for the
            algorithms that support the cutoff parameter: :meth:`edmonds_karp`
            and :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path`. Other algorithms will ignore
            this parameter. Default value: None.

        Returns
        -------
        K : integer
            local node connectivity for nodes s and t

        Examples
        --------
        This function is not imported in the base NetworkX namespace, so you
        have to explicitly import it from the connectivity package:

        >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import local_node_connectivity

        We use in this example the platonic icosahedral graph, which has node
        connectivity 5.

        >>> G = nx.icosahedral_graph()
        >>> local_node_connectivity(G, 0, 6)
        5

        If you need to compute local connectivity on several pairs of
        nodes in the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse the
        data structures that NetworkX uses in the computation: the
        auxiliary digraph for node connectivity, and the residual
        network for the underlying maximum flow computation.

        Example of how to compute local node connectivity among
        all pairs of nodes of the platonic icosahedral graph reusing
        the data structures.

        >>> import itertools
        >>> # You also have to explicitly import the function for
        >>> # building the auxiliary digraph from the connectivity package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import build_auxiliary_node_connectivity
        ...
        >>> H = build_auxiliary_node_connectivity(G)
        >>> # And the function for building the residual network from the
        >>> # flow package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import build_residual_network
        >>> # Note that the auxiliary digraph has an edge attribute named capacity
        >>> R = build_residual_network(H, "capacity")
        >>> result = dict.fromkeys(G, dict())
        >>> # Reuse the auxiliary digraph and the residual network by passing them
        >>> # as parameters
        >>> for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2):
        ...     k = local_node_connectivity(G, u, v, auxiliary=H, residual=R)
        ...     result[u][v] = k
        ...
        >>> all(result[u][v] == 5 for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2))
        True

        You can also use alternative flow algorithms for computing node
        connectivity. For instance, in dense networks the algorithm
        :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better than
        the default :meth:`edmonds_karp` which is faster for sparse
        networks with highly skewed degree distributions. Alternative flow
        functions have to be explicitly imported from the flow package.

        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import shortest_augmenting_path
        >>> local_node_connectivity(G, 0, 6, flow_func=shortest_augmenting_path)
        5

        Notes
        -----
        This is a flow based implementation of node connectivity. We compute the
        maximum flow using, by default, the :meth:`edmonds_karp` algorithm (see:
        :meth:`maximum_flow`) on an auxiliary digraph build from the original
        input graph:

        For an undirected graph G having `n` nodes and `m` edges we derive a
        directed graph H with `2n` nodes and `2m+n` arcs by replacing each
        original node `v` with two nodes `v_A`, `v_B` linked by an (internal)
        arc in H. Then for each edge (`u`, `v`) in G we add two arcs
        (`u_B`, `v_A`) and (`v_B`, `u_A`) in H. Finally we set the attribute
        capacity = 1 for each arc in H [1]_ .

        For a directed graph G having `n` nodes and `m` arcs we derive a
        directed graph H with `2n` nodes and `m+n` arcs by replacing each
        original node `v` with two nodes `v_A`, `v_B` linked by an (internal)
        arc (`v_A`, `v_B`) in H. Then for each arc (`u`, `v`) in G we add one arc
        (`u_B`, `v_A`) in H. Finally we set the attribute capacity = 1 for
        each arc in H.

        This is equal to the local node connectivity because the value of
        a maximum s-t-flow is equal to the capacity of a minimum s-t-cut.

        Notes
        -----
        This is a flow based implementation of node connectivity. The
        algorithm works by solving $O((n-\delta-1+\delta(\delta-1)/2))$
        maximum flow problems on an auxiliary digraph. Where $\delta$
        is the minimum degree of G. For details about the auxiliary
        digraph and the computation of local node connectivity see
        :meth:`local_node_connectivity`. This implementation is based

        all pairs of nodes of the platonic icosahedral graph reusing

        Notes
        -----
        This is a flow based implementation of edge connectivity. We compute the
        maximum flow using, by default, the :meth:`edmonds_karp` algorithm on an
        auxiliary digraph build from the original input graph:

        If the input graph is undirected, we replace each edge (`u`,`v`) with
        two reciprocal arcs (`u`, `v`) and (`v`, `u`) and then we set the attribute
        'capacity' for each arc to 1. If the input graph is directed we simply
        add the 'capacity' attribute. This is an implementation of algorithm 1
        in [1]_.

        The maximum flow in the auxiliary network is equal to the local edge
        connectivity because the value of a maximum s-t-flow is equal to the
        capacity of a minimum s-t-cut (Ford and Fulkerson theorem).

            Undirected or directed graph

        s : node
            Source node. Optional. Default value: None.

        t : node
            Target node. Optional. Default value: None.

        flow_func : function
            A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
            The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph,
            a source node, and a target node. And return a residual network
            that follows NetworkX conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for
            details). If flow_func is None, the default maximum flow function
            (:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. See below for details. The
            choice of the default function may change from version
            to version and should not be relied on. Default value: None.

        cutoff : integer, float
            If specified, the maximum flow algorithm will terminate when the
            flow value reaches or exceeds the cutoff. This is only for the
            algorithms that support the cutoff parameter: e.g., :meth:`edmonds_karp`
            and :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path`. Other algorithms will ignore
            this parameter. Default value: None.

        Returns
        -------
        K : integer
            Edge connectivity for G, or local edge connectivity if source
            and target were provided

        Examples
        --------
        >>> # Platonic icosahedral graph is 5-edge-connected
        >>> G = nx.icosahedral_graph()
        >>> nx.edge_connectivity(G)
        5

        You can use alternative flow algorithms for the underlying
        maximum flow computation. In dense networks the algorithm
        :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better
        than the default :meth:`edmonds_karp`, which is faster for
        sparse networks with highly skewed degree distributions.
        Alternative flow functions have to be explicitly imported
        from the flow package.

        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import shortest_augmenting_path
        >>> nx.edge_connectivity(G, flow_func=shortest_augmenting_path)
        5

        If you specify a pair of nodes (source and target) as parameters,
        this function returns the value of local edge connectivity.

        >>> nx.edge_connectivity(G, 3, 7)
        5

        If you need to perform several local computations among different
        pairs of nodes on the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse
        the data structures used in the maximum flow computations. See
        :meth:`local_edge_connectivity` for details.

        Notes
        -----
        This is a flow based implementation of global edge connectivity.
        For undirected graphs the algorithm works by finding a 'small'
        dominating set of nodes of G (see algorithm 7 in [1]_ ) and
        computing local maximum flow (see :meth:`local_edge_connectivity`)
        between an arbitrary node in the dominating set and the rest of
        nodes in it. This is an implementation of algorithm 6 in [1]_ .
        For directed graphs, the algorithm does n calls to the maximum
        flow function. This is an implementation of algorithm 8 in [1]_ .
