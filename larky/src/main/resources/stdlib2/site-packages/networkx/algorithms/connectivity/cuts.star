def minimum_st_edge_cut(G, s, t, flow_func=None, auxiliary=None, residual=None):
    """
    Returns the edges of the cut-set of a minimum (s, t)-cut.

        This function returns the set of edges of minimum cardinality that,
        if removed, would destroy all paths among source and target in G.
        Edge weights are not considered. See :meth:`minimum_cut` for
        computing minimum cuts considering edge weights.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        s : node
            Source node for the flow.

        t : node
            Sink node for the flow.

        auxiliary : NetworkX DiGraph
            Auxiliary digraph to compute flow based node connectivity. It has
            to have a graph attribute called mapping with a dictionary mapping
            node names in G and in the auxiliary digraph. If provided
            it will be reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

        flow_func : function
            A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
            The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph,
            a source node, and a target node. And return a residual network
            that follows NetworkX conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for
            details). If flow_func is None, the default maximum flow function
            (:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. See :meth:`node_connectivity` for
            details. The choice of the default function may change from version
            to version and should not be relied on. Default value: None.

        residual : NetworkX DiGraph
            Residual network to compute maximum flow. If provided it will be
            reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

        Returns
        -------
        cutset : set
            Set of edges that, if removed from the graph, will disconnect it.

        Examples
        --------
        This function is not imported in the base NetworkX namespace, so you
        have to explicitly import it from the connectivity package:

        >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import minimum_st_edge_cut

        We use in this example the platonic icosahedral graph, which has edge
        connectivity 5.

        >>> G = nx.icosahedral_graph()
        >>> len(minimum_st_edge_cut(G, 0, 6))
        5

        If you need to compute local edge cuts on several pairs of
        nodes in the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse the
        data structures that NetworkX uses in the computation: the
        auxiliary digraph for edge connectivity, and the residual
        network for the underlying maximum flow computation.

        Example of how to compute local edge cuts among all pairs of
        nodes of the platonic icosahedral graph reusing the data
        structures.

        >>> import itertools
        >>> # You also have to explicitly import the function for
        >>> # building the auxiliary digraph from the connectivity package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity
        >>> H = build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity(G)
        >>> # And the function for building the residual network from the
        >>> # flow package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import build_residual_network
        >>> # Note that the auxiliary digraph has an edge attribute named capacity
        >>> R = build_residual_network(H, "capacity")
        >>> result = dict.fromkeys(G, dict())
        >>> # Reuse the auxiliary digraph and the residual network by passing them
        >>> # as parameters
        >>> for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2):
        ...     k = len(minimum_st_edge_cut(G, u, v, auxiliary=H, residual=R))
        ...     result[u][v] = k
        >>> all(result[u][v] == 5 for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2))
        True

        You can also use alternative flow algorithms for computing edge
        cuts. For instance, in dense networks the algorithm
        :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better than
        the default :meth:`edmonds_karp` which is faster for sparse
        networks with highly skewed degree distributions. Alternative flow
        functions have to be explicitly imported from the flow package.

        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import shortest_augmenting_path
        >>> len(minimum_st_edge_cut(G, 0, 6, flow_func=shortest_augmenting_path))
        5

        This function returns the set of nodes of minimum cardinality that,

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        s : node
            Source node.

        t : node
            Target node.

        flow_func : function
            A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
            The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph,

            Residual network to compute maximum flow. If provided it will be
            reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

        Returns
        -------
        cutset : set
            Set of nodes that, if removed, would destroy all paths between
            source and target in G.

        Examples
        --------
        This function is not imported in the base NetworkX namespace, so you
        have to explicitly import it from the connectivity package:

        >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import minimum_st_node_cut

        We use in this example the platonic icosahedral graph, which has node
        connectivity 5.

        >>> G = nx.icosahedral_graph()
        >>> len(minimum_st_node_cut(G, 0, 6))
        5

        If you need to compute local st cuts between several pairs of
        nodes in the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse the
        data structures that NetworkX uses in the computation: the
        auxiliary digraph for node connectivity and node cuts, and the
        residual network for the underlying maximum flow computation.

        Example of how to compute local st node cuts reusing the data
        structures:

        >>> # You also have to explicitly import the function for
        >>> # building the auxiliary digraph from the connectivity package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import build_auxiliary_node_connectivity
        >>> H = build_auxiliary_node_connectivity(G)
        >>> # And the function for building the residual network from the
        >>> # flow package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import build_residual_network
        >>> # Note that the auxiliary digraph has an edge attribute named capacity
        >>> R = build_residual_network(H, "capacity")
        >>> # Reuse the auxiliary digraph and the residual network by passing them
        >>> # as parameters
        >>> len(minimum_st_node_cut(G, 0, 6, auxiliary=H, residual=R))
        5

        You can also use alternative flow algorithms for computing minimum st
        node cuts. For instance, in dense networks the algorithm
        :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better than
        the default :meth:`edmonds_karp` which is faster for sparse
        networks with highly skewed degree distributions. Alternative flow

        Notes
        -----
        This is a flow based implementation of minimum node cut. The algorithm
        is based in solving a number of maximum flow computations to determine
        the capacity of the minimum cut on an auxiliary directed network that
        corresponds to the minimum node cut of G. It handles both directed
        and undirected graphs. This implementation is based on algorithm 11
        in [1]_.

        Notes
        -----
        This is a flow based implementation of minimum edge cut. For
        undirected graphs the algorithm works by finding a 'small' dominating
        set of nodes of G (see algorithm 7 in [1]_) and computing the maximum
        flow between an arbitrary node in the dominating set and the rest of
        nodes in it. This is an implementation of algorithm 6 in [1]_. For
        directed graphs, the algorithm does n calls to the max flow function.
        The function raises an error if the directed graph is not weakly
        connected and returns an empty set if it is weakly connected.
        It is an implementation of algorithm 8 in [1]_.
