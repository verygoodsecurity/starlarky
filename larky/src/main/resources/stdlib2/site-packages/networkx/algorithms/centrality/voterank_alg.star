def voterank(G, number_of_nodes=None):
    """
    Select a list of influential nodes in a graph using VoteRank algorithm

        VoteRank [1]_ computes a ranking of the nodes in a graph G based on a
        voting scheme. With VoteRank, all nodes vote for each of its in-neighbours
        and the node with the highest votes is elected iteratively. The voting
        ability of out-neighbors of elected nodes is decreased in subsequent turns.

        Note: We treat each edge independently in case of multigraphs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A NetworkX graph.

        number_of_nodes : integer, optional
            Number of ranked nodes to extract (default all nodes).

        Returns
        -------
        voterank : list
            Ordered list of computed seeds.
            Only nodes with positive number of votes are returned.
