def k_components(G, min_density=0.95):
    """
    r"""Returns the approximate k-component structure of a graph G.

        A `k`-component is a maximal subgraph of a graph G that has, at least,
        node connectivity `k`: we need to remove at least `k` nodes to break it
        into more components. `k`-components have an inherent hierarchical
        structure because they are nested in terms of connectivity: a connected
        graph can contain several 2-components, each of which can contain
        one or more 3-components, and so forth.

        This implementation is based on the fast heuristics to approximate
        the `k`-component structure of a graph [1]_. Which, in turn, it is based on
        a fast approximation algorithm for finding good lower bounds of the number
        of node independent paths between two nodes [2]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        min_density : Float
            Density relaxation threshold. Default value 0.95

        Returns
        -------
        k_components : dict
            Dictionary with connectivity level `k` as key and a list of
            sets of nodes that form a k-component of level `k` as values.


        Examples
        --------
        >>> # Petersen graph has 10 nodes and it is triconnected, thus all
        >>> # nodes are in a single component on all three connectivity levels
        >>> from networkx.algorithms import approximation as apxa
        >>> G = nx.petersen_graph()
        >>> k_components = apxa.k_components(G)

        Notes
        -----
        The logic of the approximation algorithm for computing the `k`-component
        structure [1]_ is based on repeatedly applying simple and fast algorithms
        for `k`-cores and biconnected components in order to narrow down the
        number of pairs of nodes over which we have to compute White and Newman's
        approximation algorithm for finding node independent paths [2]_. More
        formally, this algorithm is based on Whitney's theorem, which states
        an inclusion relation among node connectivity, edge connectivity, and
        minimum degree for any graph G. This theorem implies that every
        `k`-component is nested inside a `k`-edge-component, which in turn,
        is contained in a `k`-core. Thus, this algorithm computes node independent
        paths among pairs of nodes in each biconnected part of each `k`-core,
        and repeats this procedure for each `k` from 3 to the maximal core number
        of a node in the input graph.

        Because, in practice, many nodes of the core of level `k` inside a
        bicomponent actually are part of a component of level k, the auxiliary
        graph needed for the algorithm is likely to be very dense. Thus, we use
        a complement graph data structure (see `AntiGraph`) to save memory.
        AntiGraph only stores information of the edges that are *not* present
        in the actual auxiliary graph. When applying algorithms to this
        complement graph data structure, it behaves as if it were the dense
        version.

        Class for complement graphs.

        The main goal is to be able to work with big and dense graphs with
        a low memory foodprint.

        In this class you add the edges that *do not exist* in the dense graph,
        the report methods of the class return the neighbors, the edges and
        the degree as if it was the dense graph. Thus it's possible to use
        an instance of this class with some of NetworkX functions. In this
        case we only use k-core, connected_components, and biconnected_components.
