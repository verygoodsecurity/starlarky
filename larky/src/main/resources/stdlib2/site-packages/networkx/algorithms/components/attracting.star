def attracting_components(G):
    """
    Generates the attracting components in `G`.

        An attracting component in a directed graph `G` is a strongly connected
        component with the property that a random walker on the graph will never
        leave the component, once it enters the component.

        The nodes in attracting components can also be thought of as recurrent
        nodes.  If a random walker enters the attractor containing the node, then
        the node will be visited infinitely often.

        To obtain induced subgraphs on each component use:
        ``(G.subgraph(c).copy() for c in attracting_components(G))``

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : DiGraph, MultiDiGraph
            The graph to be analyzed.

        Returns
        -------
        attractors : generator of sets
            A generator of sets of nodes, one for each attracting component of G.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNotImplemented
            If the input graph is undirected.

def number_attracting_components(G):

    Returns the number of attracting components in `G`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : DiGraph, MultiDiGraph
            The graph to be analyzed.

        Returns
        -------

            The number of attracting components in G.
