def reciprocity(G, nodes=None):
    """
    r"""Compute the reciprocity in a directed graph.

        The reciprocity of a directed graph is defined as the ratio
        of the number of edges pointing in both directions to the total
        number of edges in the graph.
        Formally, $r = |{(u,v) \in G|(v,u) \in G}| / |{(u,v) \in G}|$.

        The reciprocity of a single node u is defined similarly,
        it is the ratio of the number of edges in both directions to
        the total number of edges attached to node u.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
           A networkx directed graph
        nodes : container of nodes, optional (default=whole graph)
           Compute reciprocity for nodes in this container.

        Returns
        -------
        out : dictionary
           Reciprocity keyed by node label.

        Notes
        -----
        The reciprocity is not defined for isolated nodes.
        In such cases this function will return None.

    
    """
def _reciprocity_iter(G, nodes):
    """
     Return an iterator of (node, reciprocity).
    
    """
def overall_reciprocity(G):
    """
    Compute the reciprocity for the whole graph.

        See the doc of reciprocity for the definition.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
           A networkx graph
