def sigma(G, niter=100, nrand=10, seed=None):

    Returns the small-world coefficient (sigma) of the given graph.

        The small-world coefficient is defined as:

        average shortest path length of G. Cr and Lr are respectively the average
        clustering coefficient and average shortest path length of an equivalent
        random graph.

        A graph is commonly classified as small-world if sigma>1.

def omega(G, niter=100, nrand=10, seed=None):
    """
    Returns the small-world coefficient (omega) of a graph

        The small-world coefficient of a graph G is:

        omega = Lr/L - C/Cl

        where C and L are respectively the average clustering coefficient and
        average shortest path length of G. Lr is the average shortest path length
        of an equivalent random graph and Cl is the average clustering coefficient
        of an equivalent lattice graph.

        The small-world coefficient (omega) ranges between -1 and 1. Values close
        to 0 means the G features small-world characteristics. Values close to -1
        means G has a lattice shape whereas values close to 1 means G is a random
        graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            An undirected graph.

        niter: integer (optional, default=100)
