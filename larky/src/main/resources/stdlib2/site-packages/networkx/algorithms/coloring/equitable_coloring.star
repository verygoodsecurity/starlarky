def equitable_color(G, num_colors):
    """
    Provides equitable (r + 1)-coloring for nodes of G in O(r * n^2) time
         if deg(G) <= r. The algorithm is described in [1]_.

         Attempts to color a graph using r colors, where no neighbors of a node
         can have same color as the node itself and the number of nodes with each
         color differ by at most 1.

         Parameters
         ----------
         G : networkX graph
            The nodes of this graph will be colored.

         num_colors : number of colors to use
            This number must be at least one more than the maximum degree of nodes
            in the graph.

         Returns
         -------
         A dictionary with keys representing nodes and values representing
         corresponding coloring.

         Examples
         --------
         >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
         >>> d = nx.coloring.equitable_color(G, num_colors=3)
         >>> nx.algorithms.coloring.equitable_coloring.is_equitable(G, d)
         True

         Raises
         ------
         NetworkXAlgorithmError
             If the maximum degree of the graph ``G`` is greater than
             ``num_colors``.
