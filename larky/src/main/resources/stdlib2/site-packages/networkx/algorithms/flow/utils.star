        Build a residual network and initialize a zero flow.

            The residual network :samp:`R` from an input graph :samp:`G` has the
            same nodes as :samp:`G`. :samp:`R` is a DiGraph that contains a pair
            of edges :samp:`(u, v)` and :samp:`(v, u)` iff :samp:`(u, v)` is not a
            self-loop, and at least one of :samp:`(u, v)` and :samp:`(v, u)` exists
            in :samp:`G`.

            For each edge :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`R`, :samp:`R[u][v]['capacity']`
            is equal to the capacity of :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`G` if it exists
            in :samp:`G` or zero otherwise. If the capacity is infinite,
            :samp:`R[u][v]['capacity']` will have a high arbitrary finite value
            that does not affect the solution of the problem. This value is stored in
            :samp:`R.graph['inf']`. For each edge :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`R`,
            :samp:`R[u][v]['flow']` represents the flow function of :samp:`(u, v)` and
            satisfies :samp:`R[u][v]['flow'] == -R[v][u]['flow']`.

            The flow value, defined as the total flow into :samp:`t`, the sink, is
            stored in :samp:`R.graph['flow_value']`. If :samp:`cutoff` is not
            specified, reachability to :samp:`t` using only edges :samp:`(u, v)` such
            that :samp:`R[u][v]['flow'] < R[u][v]['capacity']` induces a minimum
            :samp:`s`-:samp:`t` cut.
