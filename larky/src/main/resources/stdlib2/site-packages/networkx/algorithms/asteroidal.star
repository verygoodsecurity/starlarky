def find_asteroidal_triple(G):
    """
    r"""Find an asteroidal triple in the given graph.

        An asteroidal triple is a triple of non-adjacent vertices such that
        there exists a path between any two of them which avoids the closed
        neighborhood of the third. It checks all independent triples of vertices
        and whether they are an asteroidal triple or not. This is done with the
        help of a data structure called a component structure.
        A component structure encodes information about which vertices belongs to
        the same connected component when the closed neighborhood of a given vertex
        is removed from the graph. The algorithm used to check is the trivial
        one, outlined in [1]_, which has a runtime of
        :math:`O(|V||\overline{E} + |V||E|)`, where the second term is the
        creation of the component structure.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX Graph
            The graph to check whether is AT-free or not

        Returns
        -------
        list or None
            An asteroidal triple is returned as a list of nodes. If no asteroidal
            triple exists, i.e. the graph is AT-free, then None is returned.
            The returned value depends on the certificate parameter. The default
            option is a bool which is True if the graph is AT-free, i.e. the
            given graph contains no asteroidal triples, and False otherwise, i.e.
            if the graph contains at least one asteroidal triple.

        Notes
        -----
        The component structure and the algorithm is described in [1]_. The current
        implementation implements the trivial algorithm for simple graphs.

def is_at_free(G):
    """
    Check if a graph is AT-free.

        The method uses the `find_asteroidal_triple` method to recognize
        an AT-free graph. If no asteroidal triple is found the graph is
        AT-free and True is returned. If at least one asteroidal triple is
        found the graph is not AT-free and False is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX Graph
            The graph to check whether is AT-free or not.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if G is AT-free and False otherwise.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 5)])
        >>> nx.is_at_free(G)
        True

        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(6)
        >>> nx.is_at_free(G)
        False

def create_component_structure(G):
    """
    r"""Create component structure for G.

        A *component structure* is an `nxn` array, denoted `c`, where `n` is
        the number of vertices,  where each row and column corresponds to a vertex.

        .. math::
            c_{uv} = \begin{cases} 0, if v \in N[u] \\
                k, if v \in component k of G \setminus N[u] \end{cases}

        Where `k` is an arbitrary label for each component. The structure is used
        to simplify the detection of asteroidal triples.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX Graph
            Undirected, simple graph.

        Returns
        -------
        component_structure : dictionary
            A dictionary of dictionaries, keyed by pairs of vertices.
