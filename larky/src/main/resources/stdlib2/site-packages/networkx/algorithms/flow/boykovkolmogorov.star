def boykov_kolmogorov(
    G, s, t, capacity="capacity", residual=None, value_only=False, cutoff=None
):
    """
    r"""Find a maximum single-commodity flow using Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm.

        This function returns the residual network resulting after computing
        the maximum flow. See below for details about the conventions
        NetworkX uses for defining residual networks.

        This algorithm has worse case complexity $O(n^2 m |C|)$ for $n$ nodes, $m$
        edges, and $|C|$ the cost of the minimum cut [1]_. This implementation
        uses the marking heuristic defined in [2]_ which improves its running
        time in many practical problems.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Edges of the graph are expected to have an attribute called
            'capacity'. If this attribute is not present, the edge is
            considered to have infinite capacity.

        s : node
            Source node for the flow.

        t : node
            Sink node for the flow.

        capacity : string
            Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute capacity
            that indicates how much flow the edge can support. If this
            attribute is not present, the edge is considered to have
            infinite capacity. Default value: 'capacity'.

        residual : NetworkX graph
            Residual network on which the algorithm is to be executed. If None, a
            new residual network is created. Default value: None.

        value_only : bool
            If True compute only the value of the maximum flow. This parameter
            will be ignored by this algorithm because it is not applicable.

        cutoff : integer, float
            If specified, the algorithm will terminate when the flow value reaches
            or exceeds the cutoff. In this case, it may be unable to immediately
            determine a minimum cut. Default value: None.

        Returns
        -------
        R : NetworkX DiGraph
            Residual network after computing the maximum flow.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            The algorithm does not support MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph. If
            the input graph is an instance of one of these two classes, a
            NetworkXError is raised.

        NetworkXUnbounded
            If the graph has a path of infinite capacity, the value of a
            feasible flow on the graph is unbounded above and the function
            raises a NetworkXUnbounded.

        Notes
        -----
        The residual network :samp:`R` from an input graph :samp:`G` has the
        same nodes as :samp:`G`. :samp:`R` is a DiGraph that contains a pair
        of edges :samp:`(u, v)` and :samp:`(v, u)` iff :samp:`(u, v)` is not a
        self-loop, and at least one of :samp:`(u, v)` and :samp:`(v, u)` exists
        in :samp:`G`.

        For each edge :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`R`, :samp:`R[u][v]['capacity']`
        is equal to the capacity of :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`G` if it exists
        in :samp:`G` or zero otherwise. If the capacity is infinite,
        :samp:`R[u][v]['capacity']` will have a high arbitrary finite value
        that does not affect the solution of the problem. This value is stored in
        :samp:`R.graph['inf']`. For each edge :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`R`,
        :samp:`R[u][v]['flow']` represents the flow function of :samp:`(u, v)` and
        satisfies :samp:`R[u][v]['flow'] == -R[v][u]['flow']`.

        The flow value, defined as the total flow into :samp:`t`, the sink, is
        stored in :samp:`R.graph['flow_value']`. If :samp:`cutoff` is not
        specified, reachability to :samp:`t` using only edges :samp:`(u, v)` such
        that :samp:`R[u][v]['flow'] < R[u][v]['capacity']` induces a minimum
        :samp:`s`-:samp:`t` cut.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import boykov_kolmogorov

        The functions that implement flow algorithms and output a residual
        network, such as this one, are not imported to the base NetworkX
        namespace, so you have to explicitly import them from the flow package.

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_edge("x", "a", capacity=3.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("x", "b", capacity=1.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("a", "c", capacity=3.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("b", "c", capacity=5.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("b", "d", capacity=4.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("d", "e", capacity=2.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("c", "y", capacity=2.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("e", "y", capacity=3.0)
        >>> R = boykov_kolmogorov(G, "x", "y")
        >>> flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, "x", "y")
        >>> flow_value
        3.0
        >>> flow_value == R.graph["flow_value"]
        True

        A nice feature of the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm is that a partition
        of the nodes that defines a minimum cut can be easily computed based
        on the search trees used during the algorithm. These trees are stored
        in the graph attribute `trees` of the residual network.

        >>> source_tree, target_tree = R.graph["trees"]
        >>> partition = (set(source_tree), set(G) - set(source_tree))

        Or equivalently:

        >>> partition = (set(G) - set(target_tree), set(target_tree))
