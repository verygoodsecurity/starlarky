def average_degree_connectivity(
    G, source="in+out", target="in+out", nodes=None, weight=None
):
    """
    r"""Compute the average degree connectivity of graph.

        The average degree connectivity is the average nearest neighbor degree of
        nodes with degree k. For weighted graphs, an analogous measure can
        be computed using the weighted average neighbors degree defined in
        [1]_, for a node `i`, as

        .. math::

            k_{nn,i}^{w} = \frac{1}{s_i} \sum_{j \in N(i)} w_{ij} k_j

        where `s_i` is the weighted degree of node `i`,
        `w_{ij}` is the weight of the edge that links `i` and `j`,
        and `N(i)` are the neighbors of node `i`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        source :  "in"|"out"|"in+out" (default:"in+out")
           Directed graphs only. Use "in"- or "out"-degree for source node.

        target : "in"|"out"|"in+out" (default:"in+out"
           Directed graphs only. Use "in"- or "out"-degree for target node.

        nodes : list or iterable (optional)
            Compute neighbor connectivity for these nodes. The default is all
            nodes.

        weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
           The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used as a weight.
           If None, then each edge has weight 1.

        Returns
        -------
        d : dict
           A dictionary keyed by degree k with the value of average connectivity.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If either `source` or `target` are not one of 'in',
            'out', or 'in+out'.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
        >>> G.edges[1, 2]["weight"] = 3
        >>> nx.k_nearest_neighbors(G)
        {1: 2.0, 2: 1.5}
        >>> nx.k_nearest_neighbors(G, weight="weight")
        {1: 2.0, 2: 1.75}

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm is sometimes called "k nearest neighbors" and is also
        available as `k_nearest_neighbors`.
