def to_nested_tuple(T, root, canonical_form=False):
    """
    Returns a nested tuple representation of the given tree.

        The nested tuple representation of a tree is defined
        recursively. The tree with one node and no edges is represented by
        the empty tuple, ``()``. A tree with ``k`` subtrees is represented
        by a tuple of length ``k`` in which each element is the nested tuple
        representation of a subtree.

        Parameters
        ----------
        T : NetworkX graph
            An undirected graph object representing a tree.

        root : node
            The node in ``T`` to interpret as the root of the tree.

        canonical_form : bool
            If ``True``, each tuple is sorted so that the function returns
            a canonical form for rooted trees. This means "lighter" subtrees
            will appear as nested tuples before "heavier" subtrees. In this
            way, each isomorphic rooted tree has the same nested tuple
            representation.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            A nested tuple representation of the tree.

        Notes
        -----
        This function is *not* the inverse of :func:`from_nested_tuple`; the
        only guarantee is that the rooted trees are isomorphic.

        to_prufer_sequence

        Examples
        --------
        The tree need not be a balanced binary tree::

            >>> T = nx.Graph()
            >>> T.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)])
            >>> T.add_edges_from([(1, 4), (1, 5)])
            >>> T.add_edges_from([(3, 6), (3, 7)])
            >>> root = 0
            >>> nx.to_nested_tuple(T, root)
            (((), ()), (), ((), ()))

        Continuing the above example, if ``canonical_form`` is ``True``, the
        nested tuples will be sorted::

            >>> nx.to_nested_tuple(T, root, canonical_form=True)
            ((), ((), ()), ((), ()))

        Even the path graph can be interpreted as a tree::

            >>> T = nx.path_graph(4)
            >>> root = 0
            >>> nx.to_nested_tuple(T, root)
            ((((),),),)

        Recursively compute the nested tuple representation of the
                given rooted tree.

                ``_parent`` is the parent node of ``root`` in the supertree in
                which ``T`` is a subtree, or ``None`` if ``root`` is the root of
                the supertree. This argument is used to determine which
                neighbors of ``root`` are children and which is the parent.

def from_nested_tuple(sequence, sensible_relabeling=False):

    Returns the rooted tree corresponding to the given nested tuple.

        ----------

            A nested tuple representing a rooted tree.

        sensible_relabeling : bool
            Whether to relabel the nodes of the tree so that nodes are
            labeled in increasing order according to their breadth-first
            search order from the root node.

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph
            The tree corresponding to the given nested tuple, whose root
            node is node 0. If ``sensible_labeling`` is ``True``, nodes will
