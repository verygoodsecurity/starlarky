    """
    r"""Find a maximum single-commodity flow using the highest-label
        preflow-push algorithm.

        This function returns the residual network resulting after computing
        the maximum flow. See below for details about the conventions
        NetworkX uses for defining residual networks.

        This algorithm has a running time of $O(n^2 \sqrt{m})$ for $n$ nodes and
        $m$ edges.


        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Edges of the graph are expected to have an attribute called
            'capacity'. If this attribute is not present, the edge is
            considered to have infinite capacity.

        s : node
            Source node for the flow.

        t : node
            Sink node for the flow.

        capacity : string
            Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute capacity
            that indicates how much flow the edge can support. If this
            attribute is not present, the edge is considered to have
            infinite capacity. Default value: 'capacity'.

        residual : NetworkX graph
            Residual network on which the algorithm is to be executed. If None, a
            new residual network is created. Default value: None.

        global_relabel_freq : integer, float
            Relative frequency of applying the global relabeling heuristic to speed
            up the algorithm. If it is None, the heuristic is disabled. Default
            value: 1.

        value_only : bool
            If False, compute a maximum flow; otherwise, compute a maximum preflow
            which is enough for computing the maximum flow value. Default value:
            False.

        Returns
        -------
        R : NetworkX DiGraph
            Residual network after computing the maximum flow.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            The algorithm does not support MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph. If
            the input graph is an instance of one of these two classes, a
            NetworkXError is raised.

        NetworkXUnbounded
            If the graph has a path of infinite capacity, the value of a
            feasible flow on the graph is unbounded above and the function
            raises a NetworkXUnbounded.

        Notes
        -----
        The residual network :samp:`R` from an input graph :samp:`G` has the
        same nodes as :samp:`G`. :samp:`R` is a DiGraph that contains a pair
        of edges :samp:`(u, v)` and :samp:`(v, u)` iff :samp:`(u, v)` is not a
        self-loop, and at least one of :samp:`(u, v)` and :samp:`(v, u)` exists
        in :samp:`G`. For each node :samp:`u` in :samp:`R`,
        :samp:`R.nodes[u]['excess']` represents the difference between flow into
        :samp:`u` and flow out of :samp:`u`.

        For each edge :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`R`, :samp:`R[u][v]['capacity']`
        is equal to the capacity of :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`G` if it exists
        in :samp:`G` or zero otherwise. If the capacity is infinite,
        :samp:`R[u][v]['capacity']` will have a high arbitrary finite value
        that does not affect the solution of the problem. This value is stored in
        :samp:`R.graph['inf']`. For each edge :samp:`(u, v)` in :samp:`R`,
        :samp:`R[u][v]['flow']` represents the flow function of :samp:`(u, v)` and
        satisfies :samp:`R[u][v]['flow'] == -R[v][u]['flow']`.

        The flow value, defined as the total flow into :samp:`t`, the sink, is
        stored in :samp:`R.graph['flow_value']`. Reachability to :samp:`t` using
        only edges :samp:`(u, v)` such that
        :samp:`R[u][v]['flow'] < R[u][v]['capacity']` induces a minimum
        :samp:`s`-:samp:`t` cut.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import preflow_push

        The functions that implement flow algorithms and output a residual
        network, such as this one, are not imported to the base NetworkX
        namespace, so you have to explicitly import them from the flow package.

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_edge("x", "a", capacity=3.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("x", "b", capacity=1.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("a", "c", capacity=3.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("b", "c", capacity=5.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("b", "d", capacity=4.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("d", "e", capacity=2.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("c", "y", capacity=2.0)
        >>> G.add_edge("e", "y", capacity=3.0)
        >>> R = preflow_push(G, "x", "y")
        >>> flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, "x", "y")
        >>> flow_value == R.graph["flow_value"]
        True
        >>> # preflow_push also stores the maximum flow value
        >>> # in the excess attribute of the sink node t
        >>> flow_value == R.nodes["y"]["excess"]
        True
        >>> # For some problems, you might only want to compute a
        >>> # maximum preflow.
        >>> R = preflow_push(G, "x", "y", value_only=True)
        >>> flow_value == R.graph["flow_value"]
        True
        >>> flow_value == R.nodes["y"]["excess"]
        True
