def dispersion(G, u=None, v=None, normalized=True, alpha=1.0, b=0.0, c=0.0):
    """
    r"""Calculate dispersion between `u` and `v` in `G`.

        A link between two actors (`u` and `v`) has a high dispersion when their
        mutual ties (`s` and `t`) are not well connected with each other.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A NetworkX graph.
        u : node, optional
            The source for the dispersion score (e.g. ego node of the network).
        v : node, optional
            The target of the dispersion score if specified.
        normalized : bool
            If True (default) normalize by the embededness of the nodes (u and v).

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dictionary
            If u (v) is specified, returns a dictionary of nodes with dispersion
            score for all "target" ("source") nodes. If neither u nor v is
            specified, returns a dictionary of dictionaries for all nodes 'u' in the
            graph with a dispersion score for each node 'v'.

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation follows Lars Backstrom and Jon Kleinberg [1]_. Typical
        usage would be to run dispersion on the ego network $G_u$ if $u$ were
        specified.  Running :func:`dispersion` with neither $u$ nor $v$ specified
        can take some time to complete.
