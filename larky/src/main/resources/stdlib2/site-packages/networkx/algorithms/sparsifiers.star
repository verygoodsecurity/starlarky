def spanner(G, stretch, weight=None, seed=None):
    """
    Returns a spanner of the given graph with the given stretch.

        A spanner of a graph G = (V, E) with stretch t is a subgraph
        H = (V, E_S) such that E_S is a subset of E and the distance between
        any pair of nodes in H is at most t times the distance between the
        nodes in G.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            An undirected simple graph.

        stretch : float
            The stretch of the spanner.

        weight : object
            The edge attribute to use as distance.

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph
            A spanner of the given graph with the given stretch.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If a stretch less than 1 is given.

        Notes
        -----
        This function implements the spanner algorithm by Baswana and Sen,
        see [1].

        This algorithm is a randomized las vegas algorithm: The expected
        running time is O(km) where k = (stretch + 1) // 2 and m is the
        number of edges in G. The returned graph is always a spanner of the
        given graph with the specified stretch. For weighted graphs the
        number of edges in the spanner is O(k * n^(1 + 1 / k)) where k is
        defined as above and n is the number of nodes in G. For unweighted
        graphs the number of edges is O(n^(1 + 1 / k) + kn).

    """
def _setup_residual_graph(G, weight):
    """
    Setup residual graph as a copy of G with unique edges weights.

        The node set of the residual graph corresponds to the set V' from
        the Baswana-Sen paper and the edge set corresponds to the set E'
        from the paper.

        This function associates distinct weights to the edges of the
        residual graph (even for unweighted input graphs), as required by
        the algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            An undirected simple graph.

        weight : object
            The edge attribute to use as distance.

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph
            The residual graph used for the Baswana-Sen algorithm.
    
    """
def _lightest_edge_dicts(residual_graph, clustering, node):
    """
    Find the lightest edge to each cluster.

        Searches for the minimum-weight edge to each cluster adjacent to
        the given node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        residual_graph : NetworkX graph
            The residual graph used by the Baswana-Sen algorithm.

        clustering : dictionary
            The current clustering of the nodes.

        node : node
            The node from which the search originates.

        Returns
        -------
        lightest_edge_neighbor, lightest_edge_weight : dictionary, dictionary
            lightest_edge_neighbor is a dictionary that maps a center C to
            a node v in the corresponding cluster such that the edge from
            the given node to v is the lightest edge from the given node to
            any node in cluster. lightest_edge_weight maps a center C to the
            weight of the aforementioned edge.

        Notes
        -----
        If a cluster has no node that is adjacent to the given node in the
        residual graph then the center of the cluster is not a key in the
        returned dictionaries.

def _add_edge_to_spanner(H, residual_graph, u, v, weight):
    """
    Add the edge {u, v} to the spanner H and take weight from
        the residual graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        H : NetworkX graph
            The spanner under construction.

        residual_graph : NetworkX graph
            The residual graph used by the Baswana-Sen algorithm. The weight
            for the edge is taken from this graph.

        u : node
            One endpoint of the edge.

        v : node
            The other endpoint of the edge.

        weight : object
            The edge attribute to use as distance.
