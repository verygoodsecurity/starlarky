def efficiency(G, u, v):
    """
    Returns the efficiency of a pair of nodes in a graph.

        The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes is the multiplicative inverse of the
        shortest path distance between the nodes [1]_. Returns 0 if no path
        between nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : :class:`networkx.Graph`
            An undirected graph for which to compute the average local efficiency.
        u, v : node
            Nodes in the graph ``G``.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            Multiplicative inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        Edge weights are ignored when computing the shortest path distances.

    """
def global_efficiency(G):
    """
    Returns the average global efficiency of the graph.

        The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes in a graph is the multiplicative
        inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes. The *average
        global efficiency* of a graph is the average efficiency of all pairs of
        nodes [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : :class:`networkx.Graph`
            An undirected graph for which to compute the average global efficiency.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The average global efficiency of the graph.

        Notes
        -----
        Edge weights are ignored when computing the shortest path distances.

    """
def local_efficiency(G):
    """
    Returns the average local efficiency of the graph.

        The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes in a graph is the multiplicative
        inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes. The *local
        efficiency* of a node in the graph is the average global efficiency of the
        subgraph induced by the neighbors of the node. The *average local
        efficiency* is the average of the local efficiencies of each node [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : :class:`networkx.Graph`
            An undirected graph for which to compute the average local efficiency.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The average local efficiency of the graph.
