def wiener_index(G, weight=None):
    """
    Returns the Wiener index of the given graph.

        The *Wiener index* of a graph is the sum of the shortest-path
        distances between each pair of reachable nodes. For pairs of nodes
        in undirected graphs, only one orientation of the pair is counted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        weight : object
            The edge attribute to use as distance when computing
            shortest-path distances. This is passed directly to the
            :func:`networkx.shortest_path_length` function.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The Wiener index of the graph `G`.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            If the graph `G` is not connected.

        Notes
        -----
        If a pair of nodes is not reachable, the distance is assumed to be
        infinity. This means that for graphs that are not
        strongly-connected, this function returns ``inf``.

        The Wiener index is not usually defined for directed graphs, however
        this function uses the natural generalization of the Wiener index to
        directed graphs.

        Examples
        --------
        The Wiener index of the (unweighted) complete graph on *n* nodes
        equals the number of pairs of the *n* nodes, since each pair of
        nodes is at distance one::

            >>> n = 10
            >>> G = nx.complete_graph(n)
            >>> nx.wiener_index(G) == n * (n - 1) / 2
            True

        Graphs that are not strongly-connected have infinite Wiener index::

            >>> G = nx.empty_graph(2)
            >>> nx.wiener_index(G)
            inf
