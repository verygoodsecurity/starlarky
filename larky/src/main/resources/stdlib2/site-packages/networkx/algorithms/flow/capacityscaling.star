    r"""Find a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands in digraph G.

        This is a capacity scaling successive shortest augmenting path algorithm.

        G is a digraph with edge costs and capacities and in which nodes
        have demand, i.e., they want to send or receive some amount of
        flow. A negative demand means that the node wants to send flow, a
        positive demand means that the node want to receive flow. A flow on
        the digraph G satisfies all demand if the net flow into each node
        is equal to the demand of that node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            DiGraph or MultiDiGraph on which a minimum cost flow satisfying all
            demands is to be found.

        demand : string
            Nodes of the graph G are expected to have an attribute demand
            that indicates how much flow a node wants to send (negative
            demand) or receive (positive demand). Note that the sum of the
            demands should be 0 otherwise the problem in not feasible. If
            this attribute is not present, a node is considered to have 0
            demand. Default value: 'demand'.

        capacity : string
            Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute capacity
            that indicates how much flow the edge can support. If this
            attribute is not present, the edge is considered to have
            infinite capacity. Default value: 'capacity'.

        weight : string
            Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute weight
            that indicates the cost incurred by sending one unit of flow on
            that edge. If not present, the weight is considered to be 0.
            Default value: 'weight'.

        heap : class
            Type of heap to be used in the algorithm. It should be a subclass of
            :class:`MinHeap` or implement a compatible interface.

            If a stock heap implementation is to be used, :class:`BinaryHeap` is
            recommended over :class:`PairingHeap` for Python implementations without
            optimized attribute accesses (e.g., CPython) despite a slower
            asymptotic running time. For Python implementations with optimized
            attribute accesses (e.g., PyPy), :class:`PairingHeap` provides better
            performance. Default value: :class:`BinaryHeap`.

        Returns
        -------
        flowCost : integer
            Cost of a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands.

        flowDict : dictionary
            If G is a digraph, a dict-of-dicts keyed by nodes such that
            flowDict[u][v] is the flow on edge (u, v).
            If G is a MultiDiGraph, a dict-of-dicts-of-dicts keyed by nodes
            so that flowDict[u][v][key] is the flow on edge (u, v, key).

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            This exception is raised if the input graph is not directed,
            not connected.

        NetworkXUnfeasible
            This exception is raised in the following situations:

                * The sum of the demands is not zero. Then, there is no
                  flow satisfying all demands.
                * There is no flow satisfying all demand.

        NetworkXUnbounded
            This exception is raised if the digraph G has a cycle of
            negative cost and infinite capacity. Then, the cost of a flow
            satisfying all demands is unbounded below.

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm does not work if edge weights are floating-point numbers.

        Examples
        --------
        A simple example of a min cost flow problem.
