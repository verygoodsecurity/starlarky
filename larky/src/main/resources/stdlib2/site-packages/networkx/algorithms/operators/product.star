    Returns the specified power of a graph.

        distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$ is at most $k$.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A NetworkX simple graph object.

        k : positive integer
            The power to which to raise the graph `G`.

        -------
        NetworkX simple graph
            `G` to the power `k`.

        ValueError
            If the exponent `k` is not positive.

        NetworkXNotImplemented

        The number of edges will never decrease when taking successive

        The `k`th power of a cycle graph on *n* nodes is the complete graph
        on *n* nodes, if `k` is at least ``n // 2``:

        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(5)

def rooted_product(G, H, root):

     Return the rooted product of graphs G and H rooted at root in H.

        A new graph is constructed representing the rooted product of
        the inputted graphs, G and H, with a root in H.
        A rooted product duplicates H for each nodes in G with the root
        of H corresponding to the node in G. Nodes are renamed as the direct
        product of G and H. The result is a subgraph of the cartesian product.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G,H : graph
           A NetworkX graph
        root : node
           A node in H

        R : The rooted product of G and H with a specified root in H

        Notes
