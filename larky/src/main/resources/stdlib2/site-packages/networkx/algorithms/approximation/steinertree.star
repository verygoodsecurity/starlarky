def metric_closure(G, weight="weight"):
    """
      Return the metric closure of a graph.

        The metric closure of a graph *G* is the complete graph in which each edge
        is weighted by the shortest path distance between the nodes in *G* .

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph
            Metric closure of the graph `G`.

    
    """
def steiner_tree(G, terminal_nodes, weight="weight"):
    """
     Return an approximation to the minimum Steiner tree of a graph.

        The minimum Steiner tree of `G` w.r.t a set of `terminal_nodes`
        is a tree within `G` that spans those nodes and has minimum size
        (sum of edge weights) among all such trees.

        The minimum Steiner tree can be approximated by computing the minimum
        spanning tree of the subgraph of the metric closure of *G* induced by the
        terminal nodes, where the metric closure of *G* is the complete graph in
        which each edge is weighted by the shortest path distance between the
        nodes in *G* .
        This algorithm produces a tree whose weight is within a (2 - (2 / t))
        factor of the weight of the optimal Steiner tree where *t* is number of
        terminal nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        terminal_nodes : list
             A list of terminal nodes for which minimum steiner tree is
             to be found.

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph
            Approximation to the minimum steiner tree of `G` induced by
            `terminal_nodes` .

        Notes
        -----
        For multigraphs, the edge between two nodes with minimum weight is the
        edge put into the Steiner tree.
