def is_biconnected(G):
    """
    Returns True if the graph is biconnected, False otherwise.

        A graph is biconnected if, and only if, it cannot be disconnected by
        removing only one node (and all edges incident on that node).  If
        removing a node increases the number of disconnected components
        in the graph, that node is called an articulation point, or cut
        vertex.  A biconnected graph has no articulation points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX Graph
            An undirected graph.

        Returns
        -------
        biconnected : bool
            True if the graph is biconnected, False otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNotImplemented
            If the input graph is not undirected.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
        >>> print(nx.is_biconnected(G))
        False
        >>> G.add_edge(0, 3)
        >>> print(nx.is_biconnected(G))

        Notes
        -----
        The algorithm to find articulation points and biconnected
        components is implemented using a non-recursive depth-first-search
        (DFS) that keeps track of the highest level that back edges reach
        in the DFS tree.  A node `n` is an articulation point if, and only
        if, there exists a subtree rooted at `n` such that there is no
        back edge from any successor of `n` that links to a predecessor of
        `n` in the DFS tree.  By keeping track of all the edges traversed
        by the DFS we can obtain the biconnected components because all
        edges of a bicomponent will be traversed consecutively between
        articulation points.

def biconnected_component_edges(G):

    Returns a generator of lists of edges, one list for each biconnected

        Biconnected components are maximal subgraphs such that the removal of a

        subgraph.  Note that nodes may be part of more than one biconnected

        However, each edge belongs to one, and only one, biconnected component.

def biconnected_components(G):

    Returns a generator of sets of nodes, one set for each biconnected

        Biconnected components are maximal subgraphs such that the removal of a
        node (and all edges incident on that node) will not disconnect the
        subgraph. Note that nodes may be part of more than one biconnected
        component.  Those nodes are articulation points, or cut vertices.  The
        removal of articulation points will increase the number of connected
        components of the graph.

        Notice that by convention a dyad is considered a biconnected component.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX Graph
            An undirected graph.

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : generator
            Generator of sets of nodes, one set for each biconnected component.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNotImplemented

        k_components : this function is a special case where k=2
        bridge_components : similar to this function, but is defined using
            2-edge-connectivity instead of 2-node-connectivity.


        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.lollipop_graph(5, 1)
        >>> print(nx.is_biconnected(G))
        False
        >>> bicomponents = list(nx.biconnected_components(G))
        >>> len(bicomponents)
        2
        >>> G.add_edge(0, 5)
        >>> print(nx.is_biconnected(G))
        True
        >>> bicomponents = list(nx.biconnected_components(G))
        >>> len(bicomponents)
        1

        You can generate a sorted list of biconnected components, largest
        first, using sort.

        >>> G.remove_edge(0, 5)
        >>> [len(c) for c in sorted(nx.biconnected_components(G), key=len, reverse=True)]
        [5, 2]

        If you only want the largest connected component, it's more
        efficient to use max instead of sort.

        >>> Gc = max(nx.biconnected_components(G), key=len)

        To create the components as subgraphs use:
        ``(G.subgraph(c).copy() for c in biconnected_components(G))``
