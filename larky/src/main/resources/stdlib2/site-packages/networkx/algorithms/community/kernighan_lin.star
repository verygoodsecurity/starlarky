        This is a modified form of Kernighan-Lin, which moves single nodes at a

    """
    Partition a graph into two blocks using the Kernighan–Lin
        algorithm.

        This algorithm partitions a network into two sets by iteratively
        swapping pairs of nodes to reduce the edge cut between the two sets.  The
        pairs are chosen according to a modified form of Kernighan-Lin, which
        moves node individually, alternating between sides to keep the bisection
        balanced.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph

        partition : tuple
            Pair of iterables containing an initial partition. If not
            specified, a random balanced partition is used.

        max_iter : int
            Maximum number of times to attempt swaps to find an
            improvemement before giving up.

        weight : key
            Edge data key to use as weight. If None, the weights are all
            set to one.

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
            Only used if partition is None

        Returns
        -------
        partition : tuple
            A pair of sets of nodes representing the bipartition.

        Raises
        -------
        NetworkXError
            If partition is not a valid partition of the nodes of the graph.
