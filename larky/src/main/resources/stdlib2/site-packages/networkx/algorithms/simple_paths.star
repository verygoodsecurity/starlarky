def is_simple_path(G, nodes):
    """
    Returns True if and only if `nodes` form a simple path in `G`.

        A *simple path* in a graph is a nonempty sequence of nodes in which
        no node appears more than once in the sequence, and each adjacent
        pair of nodes in the sequence is adjacent in the graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nodes : list
            A list of one or more nodes in the graph `G`.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether the given list of nodes represents a simple path in `G`.

        Notes
        -----
        An empty list of nodes is not a path but a list of one node is a
        path. Here's an explanation why.

        This function operates on *node paths*. One could also consider
        *edge paths*. There is a bijection between node paths and edge
        paths.

        The *length of a path* is the number of edges in the path, so a list
        of nodes of length *n* corresponds to a path of length *n* - 1.
        Thus the smallest edge path would be a list of zero edges, the empty
        path. This corresponds to a list of one node.

        To convert between a node path and an edge path, you can use code
        like the following::

            >>> from networkx.utils import pairwise
            >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3]
            >>> edges = list(pairwise(nodes))
            >>> edges
            [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
            >>> nodes = [edges[0][0]] + [v for u, v in edges]
            >>> nodes
            [0, 1, 2, 3]

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
        >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [2, 3, 0])
        True
        >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [0, 2])
        False

    
    """
def all_simple_paths(G, source, target, cutoff=None):
    """
    Generate all simple paths in the graph G from source to target.

        A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        source : node
           Starting node for path

        target : nodes
           Single node or iterable of nodes at which to end path

        cutoff : integer, optional
            Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

        Returns
        -------
        path_generator: generator
           A generator that produces lists of simple paths.  If there are no paths
           between the source and target within the given cutoff the generator
           produces no output.

        Examples
        --------
        This iterator generates lists of nodes::

            >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
            >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3):
            ...     print(path)
            ...
            [0, 1, 2, 3]
            [0, 1, 3]
            [0, 2, 1, 3]
            [0, 2, 3]
            [0, 3]

        You can generate only those paths that are shorter than a certain
        length by using the `cutoff` keyword argument::

            >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3, cutoff=2)
            >>> print(list(paths))
            [[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3], [0, 3]]

        To get each path as the corresponding list of edges, you can use the
        :func:`networkx.utils.pairwise` helper function::

            >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3)
            >>> for path in map(nx.utils.pairwise, paths):
            ...     print(list(path))
            [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
            [(0, 1), (1, 3)]
            [(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3)]
            [(0, 2), (2, 3)]
            [(0, 3)]

        Pass an iterable of nodes as target to generate all paths ending in any of several nodes::

            >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
            >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=[3, 2]):
            ...     print(path)
            ...
            [0, 1, 2]
            [0, 1, 2, 3]
            [0, 1, 3]
            [0, 1, 3, 2]
            [0, 2]
            [0, 2, 1, 3]
            [0, 2, 3]
            [0, 3]
            [0, 3, 1, 2]
            [0, 3, 2]

        Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
        directed acyclic graph using a functional programming approach::

            >>> from itertools import chain
            >>> from itertools import product
            >>> from itertools import starmap
            >>> from functools import partial
            >>>
            >>> chaini = chain.from_iterable
            >>>
            >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
            >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
            >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
            >>> all_paths = partial(nx.all_simple_paths, G)
            >>> list(chaini(starmap(all_paths, product(roots, leaves))))
            [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

        The same list computed using an iterative approach::

            >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
            >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
            >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
            >>> all_paths = []
            >>> for root in roots:
            ...     for leaf in leaves:
            ...         paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaf)
            ...         all_paths.extend(paths)
            >>> all_paths
            [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

        Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
        directed acyclic graph passing all leaves together to avoid unnecessary
        compute::

            >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4)])
            >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
            >>> leaves = [v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0]
            >>> all_paths = []
            >>> for root in roots:
            ...     paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaves)
            ...     all_paths.extend(paths)
            >>> all_paths
            [[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 4], [2, 1, 3], [2, 1, 4]]

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm uses a modified depth-first search to generate the
        paths [1]_.  A single path can be found in $O(V+E)$ time but the
        number of simple paths in a graph can be very large, e.g. $O(n!)$ in

        -------
        length : number
            Shortest path length.

        Returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
        The first dictionary stores distance from the source.
        The second stores the path from the source to that node.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNoPath
            If no path exists between source and target.

        Notes
        -----
        Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
        Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

        In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
        ordinary Dijkstra.

        Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
        source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
        of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
        from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
        this radius. Volume of the first sphere is pi*r*r while the
        others are 2*pi*r/2*r/2, making up half the volume.

        This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
        are negative or are floating point numbers
        (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).
