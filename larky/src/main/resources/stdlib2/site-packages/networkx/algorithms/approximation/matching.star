def min_maximal_matching(G):
    """
    r"""Returns the minimum maximal matching of G. That is, out of all maximal
        matchings of the graph G, the smallest is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
          Undirected graph

        Returns
        -------
        min_maximal_matching : set
          Returns a set of edges such that no two edges share a common endpoint
          and every edge not in the set shares some common endpoint in the set.
          Cardinality will be 2*OPT in the worst case.

        Notes
        -----
        The algorithm computes an approximate solution fo the minimum maximal
        cardinality matching problem. The solution is no more than 2 * OPT in size.
        Runtime is $O(|E|)$.
