def network_simplex(G, demand="demand", capacity="capacity", weight="weight"):
    """
    r"""Find a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands in digraph G.

        This is a primal network simplex algorithm that uses the leaving
        arc rule to prevent cycling.

        G is a digraph with edge costs and capacities and in which nodes
        have demand, i.e., they want to send or receive some amount of
        flow. A negative demand means that the node wants to send flow, a
        positive demand means that the node want to receive flow. A flow on
        the digraph G satisfies all demand if the net flow into each node
        is equal to the demand of that node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            DiGraph on which a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands is
            to be found.

        demand : string
            Nodes of the graph G are expected to have an attribute demand
            that indicates how much flow a node wants to send (negative
            demand) or receive (positive demand). Note that the sum of the
            demands should be 0 otherwise the problem in not feasible. If
            this attribute is not present, a node is considered to have 0
            demand. Default value: 'demand'.

        capacity : string
            Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute capacity
            that indicates how much flow the edge can support. If this
            attribute is not present, the edge is considered to have
            infinite capacity. Default value: 'capacity'.

        weight : string
            Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute weight
            that indicates the cost incurred by sending one unit of flow on
            that edge. If not present, the weight is considered to be 0.
            Default value: 'weight'.

        Returns
        -------
        flowCost : integer, float
            Cost of a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands.

        flowDict : dictionary
            Dictionary of dictionaries keyed by nodes such that
            flowDict[u][v] is the flow edge (u, v).

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            This exception is raised if the input graph is not directed,
            not connected or is a multigraph.

        NetworkXUnfeasible
            This exception is raised in the following situations:

                * The sum of the demands is not zero. Then, there is no
                  flow satisfying all demands.
                * There is no flow satisfying all demand.

        NetworkXUnbounded
            This exception is raised if the digraph G has a cycle of
            negative cost and infinite capacity. Then, the cost of a flow
            satisfying all demands is unbounded below.

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights or demands
        are floating point numbers (overflows and roundoff errors can
        cause problems). As a workaround you can use integer numbers by
        multiplying the relevant edge attributes by a convenient
        constant factor (eg 100).

        Examples
        --------
        A simple example of a min cost flow problem.

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_node("a", demand=-5)
        >>> G.add_node("d", demand=5)
        >>> G.add_edge("a", "b", weight=3, capacity=4)
        >>> G.add_edge("a", "c", weight=6, capacity=10)
        >>> G.add_edge("b", "d", weight=1, capacity=9)
        >>> G.add_edge("c", "d", weight=2, capacity=5)
        >>> flowCost, flowDict = nx.network_simplex(G)
        >>> flowCost
        24
        >>> flowDict  # doctest: +SKIP
        {'a': {'c': 1, 'b': 4}, 'c': {'d': 1}, 'b': {'d': 4}, 'd': {}}

        The mincost flow algorithm can also be used to solve shortest path
        problems. To find the shortest path between two nodes u and v,
        give all edges an infinite capacity, give node u a demand of -1 and
        node v a demand a 1. Then run the network simplex. The value of a
        min cost flow will be the distance between u and v and edges
        carrying positive flow will indicate the path.

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from(
        ...     [
        ...         ("s", "u", 10),
        ...         ("s", "x", 5),
        ...         ("u", "v", 1),
        ...         ("u", "x", 2),
        ...         ("v", "y", 1),
        ...         ("x", "u", 3),
        ...         ("x", "v", 5),
        ...         ("x", "y", 2),
        ...         ("y", "s", 7),
        ...         ("y", "v", 6),
        ...     ]
        ... )
        >>> G.add_node("s", demand=-1)
        >>> G.add_node("v", demand=1)
        >>> flowCost, flowDict = nx.network_simplex(G)
        >>> flowCost == nx.shortest_path_length(G, "s", "v", weight="weight")
        True
        >>> sorted([(u, v) for u in flowDict for v in flowDict[u] if flowDict[u][v] > 0])
        [('s', 'x'), ('u', 'v'), ('x', 'u')]
        >>> nx.shortest_path(G, "s", "v", weight="weight")
        ['s', 'x', 'u', 'v']

        It is possible to change the name of the attributes used for the
        algorithm.
