def union_all(graphs, rename=(None,)):
    """
    Returns the union of all graphs.

        The graphs must be disjoint, otherwise an exception is raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graphs : list of graphs
           List of NetworkX graphs

        rename : bool , default=(None, None)
           Node names of G and H can be changed by specifying the tuple
           rename=('G-','H-') (for example).  Node "u" in G is then renamed
           "G-u" and "v" in H is renamed "H-v".

        Returns
        -------
        U : a graph with the same type as the first graph in list

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
           If `graphs` is an empty list.

        Notes
        -----
        To force a disjoint union with node relabeling, use
        disjoint_union_all(G,H) or convert_node_labels_to integers().

        Graph, edge, and node attributes are propagated to the union graph.
        If a graph attribute is present in multiple graphs, then the value
        from the last graph in the list with that attribute is used.

def disjoint_union_all(graphs):
    """
    Returns the disjoint union of all graphs.

        This operation forces distinct integer node labels starting with 0
        for the first graph in the list and numbering consecutively.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graphs : list
           List of NetworkX graphs

        Returns
        -------
        U : A graph with the same type as the first graph in list

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
           If `graphs` is an empty list.

        Notes
        -----
        It is recommended that the graphs be either all directed or all undirected.

        Graph, edge, and node attributes are propagated to the union graph.
        If a graph attribute is present in multiple graphs, then the value
        from the last graph in the list with that attribute is used.
    
    """
def compose_all(graphs):
    """
    Returns the composition of all graphs.

        Composition is the simple union of the node sets and edge sets.
        The node sets of the supplied graphs need not be disjoint.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graphs : list
           List of NetworkX graphs

        Returns
        -------
        C : A graph with the same type as the first graph in list

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
           If `graphs` is an empty list.

        Notes
        -----
        It is recommended that the supplied graphs be either all directed or all
        undirected.

        Graph, edge, and node attributes are propagated to the union graph.
        If a graph attribute is present in multiple graphs, then the value
        from the last graph in the list with that attribute is used.
    
    """
def intersection_all(graphs):
    """
    Returns a new graph that contains only the edges that exist in
        all graphs.

        All supplied graphs must have the same node set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graphs : list
           List of NetworkX graphs

        Returns
        -------
        R : A new graph with the same type as the first graph in list

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
           If `graphs` is an empty list.

        Notes
        -----
        Attributes from the graph, nodes, and edges are not copied to the new
        graph.
