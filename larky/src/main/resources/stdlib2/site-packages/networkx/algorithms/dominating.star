def dominating_set(G, start_with=None):
    """
    r"""Finds a dominating set for the graph G.

        A *dominating set* for a graph with node set *V* is a subset *D* of
        *V* such that every node not in *D* is adjacent to at least one
        member of *D* [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        start_with : node (default=None)
            Node to use as a starting point for the algorithm.

        Returns
        -------
        D : set
            A dominating set for G.

        Notes
        -----
        This function is an implementation of algorithm 7 in [2]_ which
        finds some dominating set, not necessarily the smallest one.
