def non_randomness(G, k=None):
    """
    Compute the non-randomness of graph G.

        The first returned value nr is the sum of non-randomness values of all
        edges within the graph (where the non-randomness of an edge tends to be
        small when the two nodes linked by that edge are from two different
        communities).

        The second computed value nr_rd is a relative measure that indicates
        to what extent graph G is different from random graphs in terms
        of probability. When it is close to 0, the graph tends to be more
        likely generated by an Erdos Renyi model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Graph must be binary, symmetric, connected, and without self-loops.

        k : int
            The number of communities in G.
            If k is not set, the function will use a default community
            detection algorithm to set it.

        Returns
        -------
        non-randomness : (float, float) tuple
            Non-randomness, Relative non-randomness w.r.t.
            Erdos Renyi random graphs.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
        >>> nr, nr_rd = nx.non_randomness(G, 2)

        Notes
        -----
        This computes Eq. (4.4) and (4.5) in Ref. [1]_.
