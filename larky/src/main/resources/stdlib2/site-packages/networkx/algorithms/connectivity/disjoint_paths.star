def edge_disjoint_paths(
    G, s, t, flow_func=None, cutoff=None, auxiliary=None, residual=None
):
    """
    Returns the edges disjoint paths between source and target.

        Edge disjoint paths are paths that do not share any edge. The
        number of edge disjoint paths between source and target is equal
        to their edge connectivity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        s : node
            Source node for the flow.

        t : node
            Sink node for the flow.

        flow_func : function
            A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
            The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph,
            a source node, and a target node. And return a residual network
            that follows NetworkX conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for
            details). If flow_func is None, the default maximum flow function
            (:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. The choice of the default function
            may change from version to version and should not be relied on.
            Default value: None.

        cutoff : int
            Maximum number of paths to yield. Some of the maximum flow
            algorithms, such as :meth:`edmonds_karp` (the default) and
            :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` support the cutoff parameter,
            and will terminate when the flow value reaches or exceeds the
            cutoff. Other algorithms will ignore this parameter.
            Default value: None.

        auxiliary : NetworkX DiGraph
            Auxiliary digraph to compute flow based edge connectivity. It has
            to have a graph attribute called mapping with a dictionary mapping
            node names in G and in the auxiliary digraph. If provided
            it will be reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

        residual : NetworkX DiGraph
            Residual network to compute maximum flow. If provided it will be
            reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

        Returns
        -------
        paths : generator
            A generator of edge independent paths.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNoPath
            If there is no path between source and target.

        NetworkXError
            If source or target are not in the graph G.

        See also
        --------

        :meth:`edge_connectivity`
        :meth:`maximum_flow`
        :meth:`edmonds_karp`
        :meth:`preflow_push`
        :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path`

        Examples
        --------
        We use in this example the platonic icosahedral graph, which has node
        edge connectivity 5, thus there are 5 edge disjoint paths between any
        pair of nodes.

        >>> G = nx.icosahedral_graph()
        >>> len(list(nx.edge_disjoint_paths(G, 0, 6)))
        5


        If you need to compute edge disjoint paths on several pairs of
        nodes in the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse the
        data structures that NetworkX uses in the computation: the
        auxiliary digraph for edge connectivity, and the residual
        network for the underlying maximum flow computation.

        Example of how to compute edge disjoint paths among all pairs of
        nodes of the platonic icosahedral graph reusing the data
        structures.

        >>> import itertools
        >>> # You also have to explicitly import the function for
        >>> # building the auxiliary digraph from the connectivity package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity
        >>> H = build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity(G)
        >>> # And the function for building the residual network from the
        >>> # flow package
        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import build_residual_network
        >>> # Note that the auxiliary digraph has an edge attribute named capacity
        >>> R = build_residual_network(H, "capacity")
        >>> result = {n: {} for n in G}
        >>> # Reuse the auxiliary digraph and the residual network by passing them
        >>> # as arguments
        >>> for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2):
        ...     k = len(list(nx.edge_disjoint_paths(G, u, v, auxiliary=H, residual=R)))
        ...     result[u][v] = k
        >>> all(result[u][v] == 5 for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2))
        True

        You can also use alternative flow algorithms for computing edge disjoint
        paths. For instance, in dense networks the algorithm
        :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better than
        the default :meth:`edmonds_karp` which is faster for sparse
        networks with highly skewed degree distributions. Alternative flow
        functions have to be explicitly imported from the flow package.

        >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import shortest_augmenting_path
        >>> len(list(nx.edge_disjoint_paths(G, 0, 6, flow_func=shortest_augmenting_path)))
        5

        Notes
        -----
        This is a flow based implementation of edge disjoint paths. We compute
        the maximum flow between source and target on an auxiliary directed
        network. The saturated edges in the residual network after running the
        maximum flow algorithm correspond to edge disjoint paths between source
        and target in the original network. This function handles both directed
        and undirected graphs, and can use all flow algorithms from NetworkX flow
        package.
