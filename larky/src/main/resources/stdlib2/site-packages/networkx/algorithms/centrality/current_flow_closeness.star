def current_flow_closeness_centrality(G, weight=None, dtype=float, solver="lu"):
    """
    Compute current-flow closeness centrality for nodes.

        Current-flow closeness centrality is variant of closeness
        centrality based on effective resistance between nodes in
        a network. This metric is also known as information centrality.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph.

        weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
          If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
          Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

        dtype: data type (default=float)
          Default data type for internal matrices.
          Set to np.float32 for lower memory consumption.

        solver: string (default='lu')
           Type of linear solver to use for computing the flow matrix.
           Options are "full" (uses most memory), "lu" (recommended), and
           "cg" (uses least memory).

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dictionary
           Dictionary of nodes with current flow closeness centrality as the value.

        Notes
        -----
        The algorithm is from Brandes [1]_.

        See also [2]_ for the original definition of information centrality.
