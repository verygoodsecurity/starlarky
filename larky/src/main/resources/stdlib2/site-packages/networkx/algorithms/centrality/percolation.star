def percolation_centrality(G, attribute="percolation", states=None, weight=None):
    """
    r"""Compute the percolation centrality for nodes.

        Percolation centrality of a node $v$, at a given time, is defined
        as the proportion of ‘percolated paths’ that go through that node.

        This measure quantifies relative impact of nodes based on their
        topological connectivity, as well as their percolation states.

        Percolation states of nodes are used to depict network percolation
        scenarios (such as during infection transmission in a social network
        of individuals, spreading of computer viruses on computer networks, or
        transmission of disease over a network of towns) over time. In this
        measure usually the percolation state is expressed as a decimal
        between 0.0 and 1.0.

        When all nodes are in the same percolated state this measure is
        equivalent to betweenness centrality.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph.

        attribute : None or string, optional (default='percolation')
          Name of the node attribute to use for percolation state, used
          if `states` is None.

        states : None or dict, optional (default=None)
          Specify percolation states for the nodes, nodes as keys states
          as values.

        weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
          If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
          Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dictionary
           Dictionary of nodes with percolation centrality as the value.

        Notes
        -----
        The algorithm is from Mahendra Piraveenan, Mikhail Prokopenko, and
        Liaquat Hossain [1]_
        Pair dependecies are calculated and accumulated using [2]_

        For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
        Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
        paths between pairs of nodes.
