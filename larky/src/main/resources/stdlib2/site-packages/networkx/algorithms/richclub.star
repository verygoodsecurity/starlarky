def rich_club_coefficient(G, normalized=True, Q=100, seed=None):
    """
    r"""Returns the rich-club coefficient of the graph `G`.

        For each degree *k*, the *rich-club coefficient* is the ratio of the
        number of actual to the number of potential edges for nodes with
        degree greater than *k*:

        .. math::

            \phi(k) = \frac{2 E_k}{N_k (N_k - 1)}

        where `N_k` is the number of nodes with degree larger than *k*, and
        `E_k` is the number of edges among those nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph with neither parallel edges nor self-loops.
        normalized : bool (optional)
            Normalize using randomized network as in [1]_
        Q : float (optional, default=100)
            If `normalized` is True, perform `Q * m` double-edge
            swaps, where `m` is the number of edges in `G`, to use as a
            null-model for normalization.
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        rc : dictionary
           A dictionary, keyed by degree, with rich-club coefficient values.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 5)])
        >>> rc = nx.rich_club_coefficient(G, normalized=False, seed=42)
        >>> rc[0]
        0.4

        Notes
        -----
        The rich club definition and algorithm are found in [1]_.  This
        algorithm ignores any edge weights and is not defined for directed
        graphs or graphs with parallel edges or self loops.

        Estimates for appropriate values of `Q` are found in [2]_.
