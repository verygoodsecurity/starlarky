def ramsey_R2(G):
    """
    r"""Compute the largest clique and largest independent set in `G`.

        This can be used to estimate bounds for the 2-color
        Ramsey number `R(2;s,t)` for `G`.

        This is a recursive implementation which could run into trouble
        for large recursions. Note that self-loop edges are ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        Returns
        -------
        max_pair : (set, set) tuple
            Maximum clique, Maximum independent set.
