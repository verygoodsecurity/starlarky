def all_node_cuts(G, k=None, flow_func=None):
    """
    r"""Returns all minimum k cutsets of an undirected graph G.

        This implementation is based on Kanevsky's algorithm [1]_ for finding all
        minimum-size node cut-sets of an undirected graph G; ie the set (or sets)
        of nodes of cardinality equal to the node connectivity of G. Thus if
        removed, would break G into two or more connected components.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        k : Integer
            Node connectivity of the input graph. If k is None, then it is
            computed. Default value: None.

        flow_func : function
            Function to perform the underlying flow computations. Default value
            edmonds_karp. This function performs better in sparse graphs with
            right tailed degree distributions. shortest_augmenting_path will
            perform better in denser graphs.


        Returns
        -------
        cuts : a generator of node cutsets
            Each node cutset has cardinality equal to the node connectivity of
            the input graph.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> # A two-dimensional grid graph has 4 cutsets of cardinality 2
        >>> G = nx.grid_2d_graph(5, 5)
        >>> cutsets = list(nx.all_node_cuts(G))
        >>> len(cutsets)
        4
        >>> all(2 == len(cutset) for cutset in cutsets)
        True
        >>> nx.node_connectivity(G)
        2

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation is based on the sequential algorithm for finding all
        minimum-size separating vertex sets in a graph [1]_. The main idea is to
        compute minimum cuts using local maximum flow computations among a set
        of nodes of highest degree and all other non-adjacent nodes in the Graph.
        Once we find a minimum cut, we add an edge between the high degree
        node and the target node of the local maximum flow computation to make
        sure that we will not find that minimum cut again.
