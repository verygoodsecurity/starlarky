def gomory_hu_tree(G, capacity="capacity", flow_func=None):
    """
    r"""Returns the Gomory-Hu tree of an undirected graph G.

        A Gomory-Hu tree of an undirected graph with capacities is a
        weighted tree that represents the minimum s-t cuts for all s-t
        pairs in the graph.

        It only requires `n-1` minimum cut computations instead of the
        obvious `n(n-1)/2`. The tree represents all s-t cuts as the
        minimum cut value among any pair of nodes is the minimum edge
        weight in the shortest path between the two nodes in the
        Gomory-Hu tree.

        The Gomory-Hu tree also has the property that removing the
        edge with the minimum weight in the shortest path between
        any two nodes leaves two connected components that form
        a partition of the nodes in G that defines the minimum s-t
        cut.

        See Examples section below for details.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        capacity : string
            Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute capacity
            that indicates how much flow the edge can support. If this
            attribute is not present, the edge is considered to have
            infinite capacity. Default value: 'capacity'.

        flow_func : function
            Function to perform the underlying flow computations. Default value
            :func:`edmonds_karp`. This function performs better in sparse graphs
            with right tailed degree distributions.
            :func:`shortest_augmenting_path` will perform better in denser
            graphs.

        Returns
        -------
        Tree : NetworkX graph
            A NetworkX graph representing the Gomory-Hu tree of the input graph.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNotImplemented
            Raised if the input graph is directed.

        NetworkXError
            Raised if the input graph is an empty Graph.

        Examples

        >>> # The value of the minimum cut between any pair
        ... # of nodes in G is the minimum edge weight in the
        ... # shortest path between the two nodes in the
        ... # Gomory-Hu tree.

        ...     return min((T[u][v]["weight"], (u, v)) for (u, v) in zip(path, path[1:]))

        >>> T.remove_edge(*edge)
        >>> U, V = list(nx.connected_components(T))
        >>> # Thus U and V form a partition that defines a minimum cut
        ... # between u and v in G. You can compute the edge cut set,
        ... # that is, the set of edges that if removed from G will
        ... # disconnect u from v in G, with this information:
        ... cutset = set()
        >>> for x, nbrs in ((n, G[n]) for n in U):
        ...     cutset.update((x, y) for y in nbrs if y in V)
        >>> # Because we have set the capacities of all edges to 1
        ... # the cutset contains ten edges
        ... len(cutset)

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation is based on Gusfield approach [1]_ to compute
        Comory-Hu trees, which does not require node contractions and has
        the same computational complexity than the original method.
