def edge_boundary(G, nbunch1, nbunch2=None, data=False, keys=False, default=None):
    """
    Returns the edge boundary of `nbunch1`.

        The *edge boundary* of a set *S* with respect to a set *T* is the
        set of edges (*u*, *v*) such that *u* is in *S* and *v* is in *T*.
        If *T* is not specified, it is assumed to be the set of all nodes
        not in *S*.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        nbunch1 : iterable
            Iterable of nodes in the graph representing the set of nodes
            whose edge boundary will be returned. (This is the set *S* from
            the definition above.)

        nbunch2 : iterable
            Iterable of nodes representing the target (or "exterior") set of
            nodes. (This is the set *T* from the definition above.) If not
            specified, this is assumed to be the set of all nodes in `G`
            not in `nbunch1`.

        keys : bool
            This parameter has the same meaning as in
            :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

        data : bool or object
            This parameter has the same meaning as in
            :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

        default : object
            This parameter has the same meaning as in
            :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

        Returns
        -------
        iterator
            An iterator over the edges in the boundary of `nbunch1` with
            respect to `nbunch2`. If `keys`, `data`, or `default`
            are specified and `G` is a multigraph, then edges are returned
            with keys and/or data, as in :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

        Notes
        -----
        Any element of `nbunch` that is not in the graph `G` will be
        ignored.

        `nbunch1` and `nbunch2` are usually meant to be disjoint, but in
        the interest of speed and generality, that is not required here.

    
    """
def node_boundary(G, nbunch1, nbunch2=None):
    """
    Returns the node boundary of `nbunch1`.

        The *node boundary* of a set *S* with respect to a set *T* is the
        set of nodes *v* in *T* such that for some *u* in *S*, there is an
        edge joining *u* to *v*. If *T* is not specified, it is assumed to
        be the set of all nodes not in *S*.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        nbunch1 : iterable
            Iterable of nodes in the graph representing the set of nodes
            whose node boundary will be returned. (This is the set *S* from
            the definition above.)

        nbunch2 : iterable
            Iterable of nodes representing the target (or "exterior") set of
            nodes. (This is the set *T* from the definition above.) If not
            specified, this is assumed to be the set of all nodes in `G`
            not in `nbunch1`.

        Returns
        -------
        set
            The node boundary of `nbunch1` with respect to `nbunch2`.

        Notes
        -----
        Any element of `nbunch` that is not in the graph `G` will be
        ignored.

        `nbunch1` and `nbunch2` are usually meant to be disjoint, but in
