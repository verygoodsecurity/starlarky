def join(rooted_trees, label_attribute=None):
    """
    Returns a new rooted tree with a root node joined with the roots
        of each of the given rooted trees.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rooted_trees : list
            A list of pairs in which each left element is a NetworkX graph
            object representing a tree and each right element is the root
            node of that tree. The nodes of these trees will be relabeled to
            integers.

        label_attribute : str
            If provided, the old node labels will be stored in the new tree
            under this node attribute. If not provided, the node attribute
            ``'_old'`` will store the original label of the node in the
            rooted trees given in the input.

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph
            The rooted tree whose subtrees are the given rooted trees. The
            new root node is labeled 0. Each non-root node has an attribute,
            as described under the keyword argument ``label_attribute``,
            that indicates the label of the original node in the input tree.

        Notes
        -----
        Graph, edge, and node attributes are propagated from the given
        rooted trees to the created tree. If there are any overlapping graph
        attributes, those from later trees will overwrite those from earlier
        trees in the tuple of positional arguments.

        Examples
        --------
        Join two full balanced binary trees of height *h* to get a full
        balanced binary tree of depth *h* + 1::

            >>> h = 4
            >>> left = nx.balanced_tree(2, h)
            >>> right = nx.balanced_tree(2, h)
            >>> joined_tree = nx.join([(left, 0), (right, 0)])
            >>> nx.is_isomorphic(joined_tree, nx.balanced_tree(2, h + 1))
            True
