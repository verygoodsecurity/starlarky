def trophic_levels(G, weight="weight"):
    """
    r"""Compute the trophic levels of nodes.

        The trophic level of a node $i$ is

        .. math::

            s_i = 1 + \frac{1}{k^{in}_i} \sum_{j} a_{ij} s_j

        where $k^{in}_i$ is the in-degree of i

        .. math::

            k^{in}_i = \sum_{j} a_{ij}

        and nodes with $k^{in}_i = 0$ have $s_i = 1$ by convention.

        These are calculated using the method outlined in Levine [1]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : DiGraph
            A directed networkx graph

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dict
            Dictionary of nodes with trophic level as the vale.

def trophic_differences(G, weight="weight"):

    r"""Compute the trophic differences of the edges of a directed graph.

        The trophic difference $x_ij$ for each edge is defined in Johnson et al.
        [1]_ as:

        .. math::
            x_ij = s_j - s_i

        Where $s_i$ is the trophic level of node $i$.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : DiGraph
            A directed networkx graph

        Returns

def trophic_incoherence_parameter(G, weight="weight", cannibalism=False):
    """
    r"""Compute the trophic incoherence parameter of a graph.

        Trophic coherence is defined as the homogeneity of the distribution of
        trophic distances: the more similar, the more coherent. This is measured by
        the standard deviation of the trophic differences and referred to as the
        trophic incoherence parameter $q$ by [1].

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : DiGraph
            A directed networkx graph

        cannibalism: Boolean
            If set to False, self edges are not considered in the calculation
