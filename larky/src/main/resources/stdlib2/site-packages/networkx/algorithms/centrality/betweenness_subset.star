    r"""Compute betweenness centrality for a subset of nodes.

        .. math::

           c_B(v) =\sum_{s\in S, t \in T} \frac{\sigma(s, t|v)}{\sigma(s, t)}

        where $S$ is the set of sources, $T$ is the set of targets,
        $\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of shortest $(s, t)$-paths,
        and $\sigma(s, t|v)$ is the number of those paths
        passing through some  node $v$ other than $s, t$.
        If $s = t$, $\sigma(s, t) = 1$,
        and if $v \in {s, t}$, $\sigma(s, t|v) = 0$ [2]_.


        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph.

        sources: list of nodes
          Nodes to use as sources for shortest paths in betweenness

        targets: list of nodes
          Nodes to use as targets for shortest paths in betweenness

        normalized : bool, optional
          If True the betweenness values are normalized by $2/((n-1)(n-2))$
          for graphs, and $1/((n-1)(n-2))$ for directed graphs where $n$
          is the number of nodes in G.

        weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
          If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
          Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dictionary
           Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.

        See Also
        --------
        edge_betweenness_centrality
        load_centrality

        Notes
        -----
        The basic algorithm is from [1]_.

        For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
        Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
        paths between pairs of nodes.

        The normalization might seem a little strange but it is
        designed to make betweenness_centrality(G) be the same as
        betweenness_centrality_subset(G,sources=G.nodes(),targets=G.nodes()).

        The total number of paths between source and target is counted
        differently for directed and undirected graphs. Directed paths
        are easy to count. Undirected paths are tricky: should a path
        from "u" to "v" count as 1 undirected path or as 2 directed paths?

        For betweenness_centrality we report the number of undirected
        paths when G is undirected.

        For betweenness_centrality_subset the reporting is different.
        If the source and target subsets are the same, then we want
        to count undirected paths. But if the source and target subsets
        differ -- for example, if sources is {0} and targets is {1},
        then we are only counting the paths in one direction. They are
        undirected paths but we are counting them in a directed way.
        To count them as undirected paths, each should count as half a path.
