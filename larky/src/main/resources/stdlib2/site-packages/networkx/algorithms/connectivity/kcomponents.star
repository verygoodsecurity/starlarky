def k_components(G, flow_func=None):
    """
    r"""Returns the k-component structure of a graph G.

        A `k`-component is a maximal subgraph of a graph G that has, at least,
        node connectivity `k`: we need to remove at least `k` nodes to break it
        into more components. `k`-components have an inherent hierarchical
        structure because they are nested in terms of connectivity: a connected
        graph can contain several 2-components, each of which can contain
        one or more 3-components, and so forth.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        flow_func : function
            Function to perform the underlying flow computations. Default value
            :meth:`edmonds_karp`. This function performs better in sparse graphs with
            right tailed degree distributions. :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will
            perform better in denser graphs.

        Returns
        -------
        k_components : dict
            Dictionary with all connectivity levels `k` in the input Graph as keys
            and a list of sets of nodes that form a k-component of level `k` as
            values.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNotImplemented
            If the input graph is directed.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> # Petersen graph has 10 nodes and it is triconnected, thus all
        >>> # nodes are in a single component on all three connectivity levels
        >>> G = nx.petersen_graph()
        >>> k_components = nx.k_components(G)

        Notes
        -----
        Moody and White [1]_ (appendix A) provide an algorithm for identifying
        k-components in a graph, which is based on Kanevsky's algorithm [2]_
        for finding all minimum-size node cut-sets of a graph (implemented in
        :meth:`all_node_cuts` function):

            1. Compute node connectivity, k, of the input graph G.

            2. Identify all k-cutsets at the current level of connectivity using
               Kanevsky's algorithm.

            3. Generate new graph components based on the removal of
               these cutsets. Nodes in a cutset belong to both sides
               of the induced cut.

            4. If the graph is neither complete nor trivial, return to 1;
               else end.

        This implementation also uses some heuristics (see [3]_ for details)
        to speed up the computation.

        all_node_cuts
        biconnected_components : special case of this function when k=2
        k_edge_components : similar to this function, but uses edge-connectivity
            instead of node-connectivity

        faster than this because of the overhead of building a
        Graph and calling nx.connected_components, but it's not
        clear for us if we can use it in NetworkX because there
