    """
    r"""Compute the approximate current-flow betweenness centrality for nodes.

        Approximates the current-flow betweenness centrality within absolute
        error of epsilon with high probability [1]_.


        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph

        normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
          If True the betweenness values are normalized by 2/[(n-1)(n-2)] where
          n is the number of nodes in G.

        weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
          Key for edge data used as the edge weight.
          If None, then use 1 as each edge weight.

        dtype : data type (float)
          Default data type for internal matrices.
          Set to np.float32 for lower memory consumption.

        solver : string (default='full')
           Type of linear solver to use for computing the flow matrix.
           Options are "full" (uses most memory), "lu" (recommended), and
           "cg" (uses least memory).

        epsilon: float
            Absolute error tolerance.

        kmax: int
           Maximum number of sample node pairs to use for approximation.

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dictionary
           Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.

        --------
        current_flow_betweenness_centrality

        Notes
        -----
        The running time is $O((1/\epsilon^2)m{\sqrt k} \log n)$
        and the space required is $O(m)$ for $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.

        If the edges have a 'weight' attribute they will be used as
        weights in this algorithm.  Unspecified weights are set to 1.

    """
    r"""Compute current-flow betweenness centrality for nodes.

        Current-flow betweenness centrality uses an electrical current
        model for information spreading in contrast to betweenness
        centrality which uses shortest paths.

        Current-flow betweenness centrality is also known as
        random-walk betweenness centrality [2]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph

        Notes
        -----
        Current-flow betweenness can be computed in  $O(I(n-1)+mn \log n)$
        time [1]_, where $I(n-1)$ is the time needed to compute the
        inverse Laplacian.  For a full matrix this is $O(n^3)$ but using
        sparse methods you can achieve $O(nm{\sqrt k})$ where $k$ is the
        Laplacian matrix condition number.

        The space required is $O(nw)$ where $w$ is the width of the sparse
        Laplacian matrix.  Worse case is $w=n$ for $O(n^2)$.

        If the edges have a 'weight' attribute they will be used as
        weights in this algorithm.  Unspecified weights are set to 1.
