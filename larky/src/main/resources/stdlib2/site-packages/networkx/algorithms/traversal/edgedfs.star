def edge_dfs(G, source=None, orientation=None):
    """
    A directed, depth-first-search of edges in `G`, beginning at `source`.

        Yield the edges of G in a depth-first-search order continuing until
        all edges are generated.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.

        source : node, list of nodes
            The node from which the traversal begins. If None, then a source
            is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in
            the graph are searched.

        orientation : None | 'original' | 'reverse' | 'ignore' (default: None)
            For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not
            respect the original orientation of the edges.
            When set to 'reverse' every edge is traversed in the reverse direction.
            When set to 'ignore', every edge is treated as undirected.
            When set to 'original', every edge is treated as directed.
            In all three cases, the yielded edge tuples add a last entry to
            indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed.
            If orientation is None, the yielded edge has no direction indicated.
            The direction is respected, but not reported.

        Yields
        ------
        edge : directed edge
            A directed edge indicating the path taken by the depth-first traversal.
            For graphs, `edge` is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v`
            are the tail and head of the edge as determined by the traversal.
            For multigraphs, `edge` is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is
            the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then `u` and `v`
            are always in the order of the actual directed edge.
            If orientation is not None then the edge tuple is extended to include
            the direction of traversal ('forward' or 'reverse') on that edge.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> edges = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)]

        >>> list(nx.edge_dfs(nx.Graph(edges), nodes))
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]

        >>> list(nx.edge_dfs(nx.DiGraph(edges), nodes))
        [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)]

        >>> list(nx.edge_dfs(nx.MultiGraph(edges), nodes))
        [(0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0)]

        >>> list(nx.edge_dfs(nx.MultiDiGraph(edges), nodes))
        [(0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0), (3, 1, 0)]

        >>> list(nx.edge_dfs(nx.DiGraph(edges), nodes, orientation="ignore"))
        [(0, 1, 'forward'), (1, 0, 'forward'), (2, 1, 'reverse'), (3, 1, 'reverse')]

        >>> list(nx.edge_dfs(nx.MultiDiGraph(edges), nodes, orientation="ignore"))
        [(0, 1, 0, 'forward'), (1, 0, 0, 'forward'), (1, 0, 1, 'reverse'), (2, 1, 0, 'reverse'), (3, 1, 0, 'reverse')]

        Notes
        -----
        The goal of this function is to visit edges. It differs from the more
        familiar depth-first traversal of nodes, as provided by
        :func:`networkx.algorithms.traversal.depth_first_search.dfs_edges`, in
        that it does not stop once every node has been visited. In a directed graph
        with edges [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)], the edge (2, 1) would not be visited
        if not for the functionality provided by this function.
