def double_edge_swap(G, nswap=1, max_tries=100, seed=None):
    """
    Swap two edges in the graph while keeping the node degrees fixed.

        A double-edge swap removes two randomly chosen edges u-v and x-y
        and creates the new edges u-x and v-y::

         u--v            u  v
                becomes  |  |
         x--y            x  y

        If either the edge u-x or v-y already exist no swap is performed
        and another attempt is made to find a suitable edge pair.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
           An undirected graph

        nswap : integer (optional, default=1)
           Number of double-edge swaps to perform

        max_tries : integer (optional)
           Maximum number of attempts to swap edges

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        G : graph
           The graph after double edge swaps.

        Notes
        -----
        Does not enforce any connectivity constraints.

        The graph G is modified in place.

def connected_double_edge_swap(G, nswap=1, _window_threshold=3, seed=None):
    """
    Attempts the specified number of double-edge swaps in the graph `G`.

        A double-edge swap removes two randomly chosen edges `(u, v)` and `(x,
        y)` and creates the new edges `(u, x)` and `(v, y)`::

         u--v            u  v
                becomes  |  |
         x--y            x  y

        If either `(u, x)` or `(v, y)` already exist, then no swap is performed
        so the actual number of swapped edges is always *at most* `nswap`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
           An undirected graph

        nswap : integer (optional, default=1)
           Number of double-edge swaps to perform

        _window_threshold : integer

           The window size below which connectedness of the graph will be checked
           after each swap.

           The "window" in this function is a dynamically updated integer that
           represents the number of swap attempts to make before checking if the
           graph remains connected. It is an optimization used to decrease the
           running time of the algorithm in exchange for increased complexity of
           implementation.

           If the window size is below this threshold, then the algorithm checks
           after each swap if the graph remains connected by checking if there is a
           path joining the two nodes whose edge was just removed. If the window
           size is above this threshold, then the algorithm performs do all the
           swaps in the window and only then check if the graph is still connected.

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        int
           The number of successful swaps

        Raises
        ------

        NetworkXError

           If the input graph is not connected, or if the graph has fewer than four
           nodes.

        Notes
        -----

        The initial graph `G` must be connected, and the resulting graph is
        connected. The graph `G` is modified in place.
