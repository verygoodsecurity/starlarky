def clustering(G, nodes=None, weight=None):
    """
    r"""Compute the clustering coefficient for nodes.

        For unweighted graphs, the clustering of a node :math:`u`
        is the fraction of possible triangles through that node that exist,

        .. math::

          c_u = \frac{2 T(u)}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1)},

        where :math:`T(u)` is the number of triangles through node :math:`u` and
        :math:`deg(u)` is the degree of :math:`u`.

        For weighted graphs, there are several ways to define clustering [1]_.
        the one used here is defined
        as the geometric average of the subgraph edge weights [2]_,

        .. math::

           c_u = \frac{1}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1))}
                 \sum_{vw} (\hat{w}_{uv} \hat{w}_{uw} \hat{w}_{vw})^{1/3}.

        The edge weights :math:`\hat{w}_{uv}` are normalized by the maximum weight
        in the network :math:`\hat{w}_{uv} = w_{uv}/\max(w)`.

        The value of :math:`c_u` is assigned to 0 if :math:`deg(u) < 2`.

        For directed graphs, the clustering is similarly defined as the fraction
        of all possible directed triangles or geometric average of the subgraph
        edge weights for unweighted and weighted directed graph respectively [3]_.

        .. math::

           c_u = \frac{1}{deg^{tot}(u)(deg^{tot}(u)-1) - 2deg^{\leftrightarrow}(u)}
                 T(u),

        where :math:`T(u)` is the number of directed triangles through node
        :math:`u`, :math:`deg^{tot}(u)` is the sum of in degree and out degree of
        :math:`u` and :math:`deg^{\leftrightarrow}(u)` is the reciprocal degree of
        :math:`u`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph

        nodes : container of nodes, optional (default=all nodes in G)
           Compute clustering for nodes in this container.

        weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
           The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used as a weight.
           If None, then each edge has weight 1.

        Returns
        -------
        out : float, or dictionary
           Clustering coefficient at specified nodes

        For each node, the generalized degree shows how many edges of given

        Returns
        -------

           Generalized degree of specified nodes. The Counter is keyed by edge
           triangle multiplicity.

        In a network of N nodes, the highest triangle multiplicty an edge can have

        particular triangle multiplicity are present.

        The number of triangles node :math:`i` is attached to can be recovered from
        the generalized degree :math:`\mathbf{k}_i=(k_i^{(0)}, \dotsc,
        k_i^{(N-2)})` by :math:`(k_i^{(1)}+2k_i^{(2)}+\dotsc +(N-2)k_i^{(N-2)})/2`.
