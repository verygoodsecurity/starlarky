def hits(G, max_iter=100, tol=1.0e-8, nstart=None, normalized=True):
    """
    Returns HITS hubs and authorities values for nodes.

        The HITS algorithm computes two numbers for a node.
        Authorities estimates the node value based on the incoming links.
        Hubs estimates the node value based on outgoing links.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph

        max_iter : integer, optional
          Maximum number of iterations in power method.

        tol : float, optional
          Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method iteration.

        nstart : dictionary, optional
          Starting value of each node for power method iteration.

        normalized : bool (default=True)
           Normalize results by the sum of all of the values.

        Returns
        -------
        (hubs,authorities) : two-tuple of dictionaries
           Two dictionaries keyed by node containing the hub and authority
           values.

        Raises
        ------
        PowerIterationFailedConvergence
            If the algorithm fails to converge to the specified tolerance
            within the specified number of iterations of the power iteration
            method.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
        >>> h, a = nx.hits(G)

        Notes
        -----
        The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method
        and has no guarantee of convergence.  The iteration will stop
        after max_iter iterations or an error tolerance of
        number_of_nodes(G)*tol has been reached.

        The HITS algorithm was designed for directed graphs but this
        algorithm does not check if the input graph is directed and will
        execute on undirected graphs.
