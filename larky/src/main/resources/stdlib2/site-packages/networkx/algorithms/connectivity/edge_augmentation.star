def k_edge_augmentation(G, k, avail=None, weight=None, partial=False):

    Finds set of edges to k-edge-connect G.

        Adding edges from the augmentation to G make it impossible to disconnect G
        unless k or more edges are removed. This function uses the most efficient
        function available (depending on the value of k and if the problem is
        weighted or unweighted) to search for a minimum weight subset of available
        edges that k-edge-connects G. In general, finding a k-edge-augmentation is
        NP-hard, so solutions are not garuenteed to be minimal. Furthermore, a
        k-edge-augmentation may not exist.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
           An undirected graph.

        k : integer
            Desired edge connectivity

        avail : dict or a set of 2 or 3 tuples
            The available edges that can be used in the augmentation.

            If unspecified, then all edges in the complement of G are available.
            Otherwise, each item is an available edge (with an optional weight).

            In the unweighted case, each item is an edge ``(u, v)``.

            In the weighted case, each item is a 3-tuple ``(u, v, d)`` or a dict
            with items ``(u, v): d``.  The third item, ``d``, can be a dictionary
            or a real number.  If ``d`` is a dictionary ``d[weight]``
            correspondings to the weight.

        weight : string
            key to use to find weights if ``avail`` is a set of 3-tuples where the
            third item in each tuple is a dictionary.

        partial : boolean
            If partial is True and no feasible k-edge-augmentation exists, then all
            a partial k-edge-augmentation is generated. Adding the edges in a
            partial augmentation to G, minimizes the number of k-edge-connected
            components and maximizes the edge connectivity between those
            components. For details, see :func:`partial_k_edge_augmentation`.

        Yields
        ------
        edge : tuple
            Edges that, once added to G, would cause G to become k-edge-connected.
            If partial is False, an error is raised if this is not possible.
            Otherwise, generated edges form a partial augmentation, which
            k-edge-connects any part of G where it is possible, and maximally
            connects the remaining parts.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXUnfeasible
            If partial is False and no k-edge-augmentation exists.

        NetworkXNotImplemented
            If the input graph is directed or a multigraph.

        ValueError:
            If k is less than 1

        Notes
        -----
        When k=1 this returns an optimal solution.

        When k=2 and ``avail`` is None, this returns an optimal solution.
        Otherwise when k=2, this returns a 2-approximation of the optimal solution.

        For k>3, this problem is NP-hard and this uses a randomized algorithm that
            produces a feasible solution, but provides no guarantees on the
            solution weight.

    Finds an optimal 2-edge-augmentation of G using the fewest edges.

        This is an implementation of the algorithm detailed in [1]_.
        The basic idea is to construct a meta-graph of bridge-ccs, connect leaf
        nodes of the trees to connect the entire graph, and finally connect the
        leafs of the tree in dfs-preorder to bridge connect the entire graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
           An undirected graph.

        Yields
        ------
        edge : tuple
            Edges in the bridge augmentation of G

        Notes
        -----
        Input: a graph G.
        First find the bridge components of G and collapse each bridge-cc into a
        node of a metagraph graph C, which is guaranteed to be a forest of trees.

        C contains p "leafs" --- nodes with exactly one incident edge.
        C contains q "isolated nodes" --- nodes with no incident edges.

        Theorem: If p + q > 1, then at least :math:`ceil(p / 2) + q` edges are
            needed to bridge connect C. This algorithm achieves this min number.

        The method first adds enough edges to make G into a tree and then pairs
        leafs in a simple fashion.

        Let n be the number of trees in C. Let v(i) be an isolated vertex in the
        i-th tree if one exists, otherwise it is a pair of distinct leafs nodes
        in the i-th tree. Alternating edges from these sets (i.e.  adding edges
        A1 = [(v(i)[0], v(i + 1)[1]), v(i + 1)[0], v(i + 2)[1])...]) connects C
        into a tree T. This tree has p' = p + 2q - 2(n -1) leafs and no isolated
        vertices. A1 has n - 1 edges. The next step finds ceil(p' / 2) edges to
        biconnect any tree with p' leafs.

        Convert T into an arborescence T' by picking an arbitrary root node with
        degree >= 2 and directing all edges away from the root. Note the
        implementation implicitly constructs T'.

        The leafs of T are the nodes with no existing edges in T'.
        Order the leafs of T' by DFS prorder. Then break this list in half
        and add the zipped pairs to A2.

        The set A = A1 + A2 is the minimum augmentation in the metagraph.

        To convert this to edges in the original graph

def weighted_bridge_augmentation(G, avail, weight=None):
    """
    Finds an approximate min-weight 2-edge-augmentation of G.

        This is an implementation of the approximation algorithm detailed in [1]_.
        It chooses a set of edges from avail to add to G that renders it
        2-edge-connected if such a subset exists.  This is done by finding a
        minimum spanning arborescence of a specially constructed metagraph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
           An undirected graph.

        avail : set of 2 or 3 tuples.
            candidate edges (with optional weights) to choose from

        weight : string
            key to use to find weights if avail is a set of 3-tuples where the
            third item in each tuple is a dictionary.

        Yields
        ------
        edge : tuple
            Edges in the subset of avail chosen to bridge augment G.

        Notes
        -----
        Finding a weighted 2-edge-augmentation is NP-hard.
        Any edge not in ``avail`` is considered to have a weight of infinity.
        The approximation factor is 2 if ``G`` is connected and 3 if it is not.
        Runs in :math:`O(m + n log(n))` time

def _minimum_rooted_branching(D, root):
    """
    Helper function to compute a minimum rooted branching (aka rooted
        arborescence)

        Before the branching can be computed, the directed graph must be rooted by
        removing the predecessors of root.

        A branching / arborescence of rooted graph G is a subgraph that contains a
        directed path from the root to every other vertex. It is the directed
        analog of the minimum spanning tree problem.

def collapse(G, grouped_nodes):

    Collapses each group of nodes into a single node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX Graph

        grouped_nodes:  list or generator
           Grouping of nodes to collapse. The grouping must be disjoint.
           If grouped_nodes are strongly_connected_components then this is

        -------
        C : NetworkX Graph
           The collapsed graph C of G with respect to the node grouping.  The node
           labels are integers corresponding to the index of the component in the
           list of grouped_nodes.  C has a graph attribute named 'mapping' with a
           dictionary mapping the original nodes to the nodes in C to which they
           belong.  Each node in C also has a node attribute 'members' with the set

           represents.

        Notes

        The algorithm is simple. Edges are incrementally added between parts of the

        augmenting set are pruned as long as local-edge-connectivity is not broken.

        This algorithm is greedy and does not provide optimality guarantees. It
        exists only to provide :func:`k_edge_augmentation` with the ability to
        generate a feasible solution for arbitrary k.
