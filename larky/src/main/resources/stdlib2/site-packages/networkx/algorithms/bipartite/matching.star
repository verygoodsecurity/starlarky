def hopcroft_karp_matching(G, top_nodes=None):
    """
    Returns the maximum cardinality matching of the bipartite graph `G`.

        A matching is a set of edges that do not share any nodes. A maximum 
        cardinality matching is a matching with the most edges possible. It
        is not always unique. Finding a matching in a bipartite graph can be
        treated as a networkx flow problem.
    
        The functions ``hopcroft_karp_matching`` and ``maximum_matching``
        are aliases of the same function. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

          Undirected bipartite graph

        top_nodes : container of nodes

          Container with all nodes in one bipartite node set. If not supplied
          it will be computed. But if more than one solution exists an exception
          will be raised.

        Returns
        -------
        matches : dictionary

          The matching is returned as a dictionary, `matches`, such that
          ``matches[v] == w`` if node `v` is matched to node `w`. Unmatched
          nodes do not occur as a key in `matches`.

        Raises
        ------
        AmbiguousSolution
          Raised if the input bipartite graph is disconnected and no container
          with all nodes in one bipartite set is provided. When determining
          the nodes in each bipartite set more than one valid solution is
          possible if the input graph is disconnected.

        Notes
        -----
        This function is implemented with the `Hopcroft--Karp matching algorithm
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm>`_ for
        bipartite graphs.

        Notes
        -----
        This function is implemented using the procedure guaranteed by `Konig's
        theorem
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nig%27s_theorem_%28graph_theory%29>`_,
        which proves an equivalence between a maximum matching and a minimum vertex
        cover in bipartite graphs.

        Since a minimum vertex cover is the complement of a maximum independent set
        for any graph, one can compute the maximum independent set of a bipartite
        graph this way:

        >>> G = nx.complete_bipartite_graph(2, 3)
        >>> matching = nx.bipartite.maximum_matching(G)
        >>> vertex_cover = nx.bipartite.to_vertex_cover(G, matching)
        >>> independent_set = set(G) - vertex_cover
        >>> print(list(independent_set))
        [2, 3, 4]

    """
def minimum_weight_full_matching(G, top_nodes=None, weight="weight"):
    """
    r"""Returns a minimum weight full matching of the bipartite graph `G`.

        Let :math:`G = ((U, V), E)` be a weighted bipartite graph with real weights
        :math:`w : E \to \mathbb{R}`. This function then produces a matching
        :math:`M \subseteq E` with cardinality

        .. math::
           \lvert M \rvert = \min(\lvert U \rvert, \lvert V \rvert),

        which minimizes the sum of the weights of the edges included in the
        matching, :math:`\sum_{e \in M} w(e)`, or raises an error if no such
        matching exists.

        When :math:`\lvert U \rvert = \lvert V \rvert`, this is commonly
        referred to as a perfect matching; here, since we allow
        :math:`\lvert U \rvert` and :math:`\lvert V \rvert` to differ, we
        follow Karp [1]_ and refer to the matching as *full*.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

          Undirected bipartite graph

        top_nodes : container

          Container with all nodes in one bipartite node set. If not supplied
          it will be computed.

        weight : string, optional (default='weight')

           The edge data key used to provide each value in the matrix.

        Returns
        -------
        matches : dictionary

          The matching is returned as a dictionary, `matches`, such that
          ``matches[v] == w`` if node `v` is matched to node `w`. Unmatched
          nodes do not occur as a key in `matches`.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
          Raised if no full matching exists.

        ImportError
          Raised if SciPy is not available.

        Notes
        -----
        The problem of determining a minimum weight full matching is also known as
        the rectangular linear assignment problem. This implementation defers the
        calculation of the assignment to SciPy.
