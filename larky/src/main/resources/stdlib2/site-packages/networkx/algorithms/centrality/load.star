def newman_betweenness_centrality(G, v=None, cutoff=None, normalized=True, weight=None):
    """
    Compute load centrality for nodes.

        The load centrality of a node is the fraction of all shortest
        paths that pass through that node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A networkx graph.

        normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
          If True the betweenness values are normalized by b=b/(n-1)(n-2) where
          n is the number of nodes in G.

        weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
          If None, edge weights are ignored.
          Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

        cutoff : bool, optional (default=None)
          If specified, only consider paths of length <= cutoff.

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dictionary
           Dictionary of nodes with centrality as the value.

        See Also
        --------
        betweenness_centrality()

        Notes
        -----
        Load centrality is slightly different than betweenness. It was originally
        introduced by [2]_. For this load algorithm see [1]_.

    Node betweenness_centrality helper:

        See betweenness_centrality for what you probably want.
        This actually computes "load" and not betweenness.
        See https://networkx.lanl.gov/ticket/103

        This calculates the load of each node for paths from a single source.
        (The fraction of number of shortests paths from source that go
        through each node.)

        To get the load for a node you need to do all-pairs shortest paths.

        If weight is not None then use Dijkstra for finding shortest paths.

def edge_load_centrality(G, cutoff=False):
    """
    Compute edge load.

        WARNING: This concept of edge load has not been analysed
        or discussed outside of NetworkX that we know of.
        It is based loosely on load_centrality in the sense that
        it counts the number of shortest paths which cross each edge.
        This function is for demonstration and testing purposes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A networkx graph

        cutoff : bool, optional (default=False)
            If specified, only consider paths of length <= cutoff.

        Returns
        -------
        A dict keyed by edge 2-tuple to the number of shortest paths
        which use that edge. Where more than one path is shortest
        the count is divided equally among paths.
