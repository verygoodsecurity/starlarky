def maximal_independent_set(G, nodes=None, seed=None):
    """
    Returns a random maximal independent set guaranteed to contain
        a given set of nodes.

        An independent set is a set of nodes such that the subgraph
        of G induced by these nodes contains no edges. A maximal
        independent set is an independent set such that it is not possible
        to add a new node and still get an independent set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        nodes : list or iterable
           Nodes that must be part of the independent set. This set of nodes
           must be independent.

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        indep_nodes : list
           List of nodes that are part of a maximal independent set.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXUnfeasible
           If the nodes in the provided list are not part of the graph or
           do not form an independent set, an exception is raised.

        NetworkXNotImplemented
            If `G` is directed.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
        >>> nx.maximal_independent_set(G)  # doctest: +SKIP
        [4, 0, 2]
        >>> nx.maximal_independent_set(G, [1])  # doctest: +SKIP
        [1, 3]

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm does not solve the maximum independent set problem.
