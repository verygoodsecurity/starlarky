def cycle_basis(G, root=None):
    """
     Returns a list of cycles which form a basis for cycles of G.

        A basis for cycles of a network is a minimal collection of
        cycles such that any cycle in the network can be written
        as a sum of cycles in the basis.  Here summation of cycles
        is defined as "exclusive or" of the edges. Cycle bases are
        useful, e.g. when deriving equations for electric circuits
        using Kirchhoff's Laws.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX Graph
        root : node, optional
           Specify starting node for basis.

        Returns
        -------
        A list of cycle lists.  Each cycle list is a list of nodes
        which forms a cycle (loop) in G.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.Graph()
        >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 1, 2, 3])
        >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 3, 4, 5])
        >>> print(nx.cycle_basis(G, 0))
        [[3, 4, 5, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0]]

def simple_cycles(G):
    """
    Find simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a directed graph.

        A `simple cycle`, or `elementary circuit`, is a closed path where
        no node appears twice. Two elementary circuits are distinct if they
        are not cyclic permutations of each other.

        This is a nonrecursive, iterator/generator version of Johnson's
        algorithm [1]_.  There may be better algorithms for some cases [2]_ [3]_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX DiGraph
           A directed graph

        Returns
        -------
        cycle_generator: generator
           A generator that produces elementary cycles of the graph.
           Each cycle is represented by a list of nodes along the cycle.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> edges = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph(edges)
        >>> len(list(nx.simple_cycles(G)))
        5

        To filter the cycles so that they don't include certain nodes or edges,
        copy your graph and eliminate those nodes or edges before calling

        >>> copyG = G.copy()
        >>> copyG.remove_nodes_from([1])
        >>> copyG.remove_edges_from([(0, 1)])
        >>> len(list(nx.simple_cycles(copyG)))
        3


        Notes
        -----
        The implementation follows pp. 79-80 in [1]_.

        The time complexity is $O((n+e)(c+1))$ for $n$ nodes, $e$ edges and $c$
        elementary circuits.

        A `simple cycle`, or `elementary circuit`, is a closed path where

        This version uses a recursive algorithm to build a list of cycles.

def find_cycle(G, source=None, orientation=None):

    Returns a cycle found via depth-first traversal.

        The cycle is a list of edges indicating the cyclic path.
        Orientation of directed edges is controlled by `orientation`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
            A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.

        source : node, list of nodes
            The node from which the traversal begins. If None, then a source
            is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in
            the graph are searched.

        orientation : None | 'original' | 'reverse' | 'ignore' (default: None)
            For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not
            respect the original orientation of the edges.
            When set to 'reverse' every edge is traversed in the reverse direction.
            When set to 'ignore', every edge is treated as undirected.
            When set to 'original', every edge is treated as directed.
            In all three cases, the yielded edge tuples add a last entry to
            indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed.
            If orientation is None, the yielded edge has no direction indicated.
            The direction is respected, but not reported.

        Returns
        -------
        edges : directed edges
            A list of directed edges indicating the path taken for the loop.
            If no cycle is found, then an exception is raised.
            For graphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v`
            are the tail and head of the edge as determined by the traversal.
            For multigraphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is
            the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then `u` and `v`
            are always in the order of the actual directed edge.
            If orientation is not None then the edge tuple is extended to include
            the direction of traversal ('forward' or 'reverse') on that edge.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNoCycle
            If no cycle was found.

        Examples
        --------
        In this example, we construct a DAG and find, in the first call, that there
        are no directed cycles, and so an exception is raised. In the second call,
        we ignore edge orientations and find that there is an undirected cycle.
        Note that the second call finds a directed cycle while effectively
        traversing an undirected graph, and so, we found an "undirected cycle".
        This means that this DAG structure does not form a directed tree (which
        is also known as a polytree).

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])
        >>> try:
        ...     nx.find_cycle(G, orientation="original")
        ... except:
        ...     pass
        ...
        >>> list(nx.find_cycle(G, orientation="ignore"))
