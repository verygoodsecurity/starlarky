def is_semiconnected(G, topo_order=None):
    """
    Returns True if the graph is semiconnected, False otherwise.

        A graph is semiconnected if, and only if, for any pair of nodes, either one
        is reachable from the other, or they are mutually reachable.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            A directed graph.

        topo_order: list or tuple, optional
            A topological order for G (if None, the function will compute one)

        Returns
        -------
        semiconnected : bool
            True if the graph is semiconnected, False otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNotImplemented
            If the input graph is undirected.

        NetworkXPointlessConcept
            If the graph is empty.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4, create_using=nx.DiGraph())
        >>> print(nx.is_semiconnected(G))
        True
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (3, 2)])
        >>> print(nx.is_semiconnected(G))
        False
