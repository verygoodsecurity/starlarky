def is_chordal(G):
    """
    Checks whether G is a chordal graph.

        A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least 4 has a chord
        (an edge joining two nodes not adjacent in the cycle).

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph.

        Returns
        -------
        chordal : bool
          True if G is a chordal graph and False otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.
            If the input graph is an instance of one of these classes, a
            :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> e = [
        ...     (1, 2),
        ...     (1, 3),

        ... ]
        >>> G = nx.Graph(e)
        >>> nx.is_chordal(G)
        True

        Notes
        -----
        The routine tries to go through every node following maximum cardinality
        search. It returns False when it finds that the separator for any node
        is not a clique.  Based on the algorithms in [1]_.

        Notes
        -----
        G must be a chordal graph and (s,t) an edge that is not in G.

        If a treewidth_bound is provided, the search for induced nodes will end
        as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

        The algorithm is inspired by Algorithm 4 in [1]_.

        There are different approaches to calculate the chordal
