def kl_connected_subgraph(G, k, l, low_memory=False, same_as_graph=False):
    """
    Returns the maximum locally `(k, l)`-connected subgraph of `G`.

        A graph is locally `(k, l)`-connected if for each edge `(u, v)` in the
        graph there are at least `l` edge-disjoint paths of length at most `k`
        joining `u` to `v`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            The graph in which to find a maximum locally `(k, l)`-connected
            subgraph.

        k : integer
            The maximum length of paths to consider. A higher number means a looser
            connectivity requirement.

        l : integer
            The number of edge-disjoint paths. A higher number means a stricter
            connectivity requirement.

        low_memory : bool
            If this is True, this function uses an algorithm that uses slightly
            more time but less memory.

        same_as_graph : bool
            If True then return a tuple of the form `(H, is_same)`,
            where `H` is the maximum locally `(k, l)`-connected subgraph and
            `is_same` is a Boolean representing whether `G` is locally `(k,
            l)`-connected (and hence, whether `H` is simply a copy of the input
            graph `G`).

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph or two-tuple
            If `same_as_graph` is True, then this function returns a
            two-tuple as described above. Otherwise, it returns only the maximum
            locally `(k, l)`-connected subgraph.

def is_kl_connected(G, k, l, low_memory=False):
    """
    Returns True if and only if `G` is locally `(k, l)`-connected.

        A graph is locally `(k, l)`-connected if for each edge `(u, v)` in the

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            The graph to test for local `(k, l)`-connectedness.

        k : integer
            The maximum length of paths to consider. A higher number means a looser
            connectivity requirement.

        l : integer
            The number of edge-disjoint paths. A higher number means a stricter

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether the graph is locally `(k, l)`-connected subgraph.
