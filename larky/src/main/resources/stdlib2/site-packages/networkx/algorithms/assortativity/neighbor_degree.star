def _average_nbr_deg(G, source_degree, target_degree, nodes=None, weight=None):
    """
     average degree of neighbors

def average_neighbor_degree(G, source="out", target="out", nodes=None, weight=None):
    """
    r"""Returns the average degree of the neighborhood of each node.

        The average neighborhood degree of a node `i` is

        .. math::

            k_{nn,i} = \frac{1}{|N(i)|} \sum_{j \in N(i)} k_j

        where `N(i)` are the neighbors of node `i` and `k_j` is
        the degree of node `j` which belongs to `N(i)`. For weighted
        graphs, an analogous measure can be defined [1]_,

        .. math::

            k_{nn,i}^{w} = \frac{1}{s_i} \sum_{j \in N(i)} w_{ij} k_j

        where `s_i` is the weighted degree of node `i`, `w_{ij}`
        is the weight of the edge that links `i` and `j` and
        `N(i)` are the neighbors of node `i`.


        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph

        source : string ("in"|"out")
           Directed graphs only.
           Use "in"- or "out"-degree for source node.

        target : string ("in"|"out")
           Directed graphs only.
           Use "in"- or "out"-degree for target node.

        nodes : list or iterable, optional
            Compute neighbor degree for specified nodes.  The default is
            all nodes in the graph.

        weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
           The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used as a weight.
           If None, then each edge has weight 1.

        Returns
        -------
        d: dict
           A dictionary keyed by node with average neighbors degree value.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
        >>> G.edges[0, 1]["weight"] = 5
        >>> G.edges[2, 3]["weight"] = 3

        >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G)
        {0: 2.0, 1: 1.5, 2: 1.5, 3: 2.0}
        >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, weight="weight")
        {0: 2.0, 1: 1.1666666666666667, 2: 1.25, 3: 2.0}

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> nx.add_path(G, [0, 1, 2, 3])
        >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="in", target="in")
        {0: 1.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 1.0, 3: 0.0}

        >>> nx.average_neighbor_degree(G, source="out", target="out")
        {0: 1.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0}

        Notes
        -----
        For directed graphs you can also specify in-degree or out-degree
        by passing keyword arguments.
