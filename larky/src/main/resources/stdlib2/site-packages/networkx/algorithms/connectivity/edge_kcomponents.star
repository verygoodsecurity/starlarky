    r"""A simple algorithm to find all k-edge-connected components in a graph.

        Constructing the AuxillaryGraph (which may take some time) allows for the

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation is based on [1]_. The idea is to construct an auxiliary
        graph from which the k-edge-ccs can be extracted in linear time. The
        auxiliary graph is constructed in $O(|V|\cdot F)$ operations, where F is the
        complexity of max flow. Querying the components takes an additional $O(|V|)$
        operations. This algorithm can be slow for large graphs, but it handles an
        arbitrary k and works for both directed and undirected inputs.

        The undirected case for k=1 is exactly connected components.
        The undirected case for k=2 is exactly bridge connected components.
        The directed case for k=1 is exactly strongly connected components.

                Given G=(V, E), initialize an empty auxiliary graph A.
                Choose an arbitrary source node s.  Initialize a set N of available
                nodes (that can be used as the sink). The algorithm picks an

                the ts-cut is used instead. Then, the edge (s, t) is added to the

        Implementation of the basic algorithm from _[1].  The basic idea is to find
        a global minimum cut of the graph. If the cut value is at least k, then the
        graph is a k-edge-connected subgraph and can be added to the results.
        Otherwise, the cut is used to split the graph in two and the procedure is
        applied recursively. If the graph is just a single node, then it is also
        added to the results. At the end, each result is either guaranteed to be
        a single node or a subgraph of G that is k-edge-connected.

        This implementation contains optimizations for reducing the number of calls
