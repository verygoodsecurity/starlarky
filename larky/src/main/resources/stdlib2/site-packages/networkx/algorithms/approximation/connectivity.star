def local_node_connectivity(G, source, target, cutoff=None):
    """
    Compute node connectivity between source and target.

        Pairwise or local node connectivity between two distinct and nonadjacent
        nodes is the minimum number of nodes that must be removed (minimum
        separating cutset) to disconnect them. By Menger's theorem, this is equal
        to the number of node independent paths (paths that share no nodes other
        than source and target). Which is what we compute in this function.

        This algorithm is a fast approximation that gives an strict lower
        bound on the actual number of node independent paths between two nodes [1]_.
        It works for both directed and undirected graphs.

        Parameters
        ----------

        G : NetworkX graph

        source : node
            Starting node for node connectivity

        target : node
            Ending node for node connectivity

        cutoff : integer
            Maximum node connectivity to consider. If None, the minimum degree
            of source or target is used as a cutoff. Default value None.

        Returns
        -------
        k: integer
           pairwise node connectivity

        Examples
        --------
        >>> # Platonic octahedral graph has node connectivity 4
        >>> # for each non adjacent node pair
        >>> from networkx.algorithms import approximation as approx
        >>> G = nx.octahedral_graph()
        >>> approx.local_node_connectivity(G, 0, 5)
        4

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm [1]_ finds node independents paths between two nodes by
        computing their shortest path using BFS, marking the nodes of the path
        found as 'used' and then searching other shortest paths excluding the
        nodes marked as used until no more paths exist. It is not exact because
        a shortest path could use nodes that, if the path were longer, may belong
        to two different node independent paths. Thus it only guarantees an
        strict lower bound on node connectivity.

        Note that the authors propose a further refinement, losing accuracy and
        gaining speed, which is not implemented yet.

    """
def node_connectivity(G, s=None, t=None):
    """
    r"""Returns an approximation for node connectivity for a graph or digraph G.

        Node connectivity is equal to the minimum number of nodes that
        must be removed to disconnect G or render it trivial. By Menger's theorem,
        this is equal to the number of node independent paths (paths that
        share no nodes other than source and target).

        If source and target nodes are provided, this function returns the
        local node connectivity: the minimum number of nodes that must be
        removed to break all paths from source to target in G.

        This algorithm is based on a fast approximation that gives an strict lower
        bound on the actual number of node independent paths between two nodes [1]_.
        It works for both directed and undirected graphs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Undirected graph

        s : node
            Source node. Optional. Default value: None.

        t : node
            Target node. Optional. Default value: None.

        Returns
        -------
        K : integer
            Node connectivity of G, or local node connectivity if source
            and target are provided.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> # Platonic octahedral graph is 4-node-connected
        >>> from networkx.algorithms import approximation as approx
        >>> G = nx.octahedral_graph()
        >>> approx.node_connectivity(G)

        cutoff : integer
