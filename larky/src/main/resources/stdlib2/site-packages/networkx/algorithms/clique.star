def enumerate_all_cliques(G):
    """
    Returns all cliques in an undirected graph.

        This function returns an iterator over cliques, each of which is a
        list of nodes. The iteration is ordered by cardinality of the
        cliques: first all cliques of size one, then all cliques of size
        two, etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            An undirected graph.

        Returns
        -------
        iterator
            An iterator over cliques, each of which is a list of nodes in
            `G`. The cliques are ordered according to size.

        Notes
        -----
        To obtain a list of all cliques, use
        `list(enumerate_all_cliques(G))`. However, be aware that in the
        worst-case, the length of this list can be exponential in the number
        of nodes in the graph (for example, when the graph is the complete
        graph). This function avoids storing all cliques in memory by only
        keeping current candidate node lists in memory during its search.

        The implementation is adapted from the algorithm by Zhang, et
        al. (2005) [1]_ to output all cliques discovered.

        This algorithm ignores self-loops and parallel edges, since cliques
        are not conventionally defined with such edges.

def find_cliques(G):

    Returns all maximal cliques in an undirected graph.

        For each node *v*, a *maximal clique for v* is a largest complete

        called the *maximum clique*.

        This function returns an iterator over cliques, each of which is a
        list of nodes. It is an iterative implementation, so should not
        suffer from recursion depth issues.

        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            An undirected graph.

        Returns
        -------
        iterator
            An iterator over maximal cliques, each of which is a list of

        (2006) [2]_ and discussed in Cazals and Karande (2008) [3]_. It
        essentially unrolls the recursion used in the references to avoid

        The implementation is recursive, and therefore it may run into recursion
        depth issues if G contains a clique whose number of nodes is close to the
        recursion depth limit.

        At each search node, the algorithm greedily constructs a weighted
        independent set cover of part of the graph in order to find a small set of
        nodes on which to branch.  The algorithm is very similar to the algorithm
        of Tavares et al. [1]_, other than the fact that the NetworkX version does
        not use bitsets.  This style of algorithm for maximum weight clique (and
        maximum weight independent set, which is the same problem but on the
        complement graph) has a decades-long history.  See Algorithm B of Warren
        and Hicks [2]_ and the references in that paper.
