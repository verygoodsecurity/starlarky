    """
    Returns the PageRank of the nodes in the graph.

        PageRank computes a ranking of the nodes in the graph G based on
        the structure of the incoming links. It was originally designed as
        an algorithm to rank web pages.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph.  Undirected graphs will be converted to a directed
          graph with two directed edges for each undirected edge.

        alpha : float, optional
          Damping parameter for PageRank, default=0.85.

        personalization: dict, optional
          The "personalization vector" consisting of a dictionary with a
          key some subset of graph nodes and personalization value each of those.
          At least one personalization value must be non-zero.
          If not specfiied, a nodes personalization value will be zero.
          By default, a uniform distribution is used.

        max_iter : integer, optional
          Maximum number of iterations in power method eigenvalue solver.

        tol : float, optional
          Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method solver.

        nstart : dictionary, optional
          Starting value of PageRank iteration for each node.

        weight : key, optional
          Edge data key to use as weight.  If None weights are set to 1.

        dangling: dict, optional
          The outedges to be assigned to any "dangling" nodes, i.e., nodes without
          any outedges. The dict key is the node the outedge points to and the dict
          value is the weight of that outedge. By default, dangling nodes are given
          outedges according to the personalization vector (uniform if not
          specified). This must be selected to result in an irreducible transition
          matrix (see notes under google_matrix). It may be common to have the
          dangling dict to be the same as the personalization dict.

        Returns
        -------
        pagerank : dictionary
           Dictionary of nodes with PageRank as value

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph(nx.path_graph(4))
        >>> pr = nx.pagerank(G, alpha=0.9)

        Notes
        -----
        The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method
        and has no guarantee of convergence.  The iteration will stop after
        an error tolerance of ``len(G) * tol`` has been reached. If the
        number of iterations exceed `max_iter`, a
        :exc:`networkx.exception.PowerIterationFailedConvergence` exception
        is raised.

        The PageRank algorithm was designed for directed graphs but this
        algorithm does not check if the input graph is directed and will
        execute on undirected graphs by converting each edge in the
        directed graph to two edges.

        --------
        pagerank_numpy, pagerank_scipy, google_matrix

        Raises
        ------
        PowerIterationFailedConvergence
            If the algorithm fails to converge to the specified tolerance
            within the specified number of iterations of the power iteration
            method.

    Returns the Google matrix of the graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX graph.  Undirected graphs will be converted to a directed
          graph with two directed edges for each undirected edge.

        alpha : float
          The damping factor.

          By default, a uniform distribution is used.

        nodelist : list, optional
          The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in nodelist.
          If nodelist is None, then the ordering is produced by G.nodes().

        weight : key, optional

          be the same as the personalization dict.

        Returns
        -------
        A : NumPy matrix
           Google matrix of the graph

        Notes
        -----
        The matrix returned represents the transition matrix that describes the
        Markov chain used in PageRank. For PageRank to converge to a unique
        solution (i.e., a unique stationary distribution in a Markov chain), the
        transition matrix must be irreducible. In other words, it must be that
        there exists a path between every pair of nodes in the graph, or else there
        is the potential of "rank sinks."

        This implementation works with Multi(Di)Graphs. For multigraphs the
        weight between two nodes is set to be the sum of all edge weights
        between those nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        The eigenvector calculation uses NumPy's interface to the LAPACK
        eigenvalue solvers.  This will be the fastest and most accurate
        for small graphs.
