def immediate_dominators(G, start):
    """
    Returns the immediate dominators of all nodes of a directed graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : a DiGraph or MultiDiGraph
            The graph where dominance is to be computed.

        start : node
            The start node of dominance computation.

        Returns
        -------
        idom : dict keyed by nodes
            A dict containing the immediate dominators of each node reachable from
            `start`.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXNotImplemented
            If `G` is undirected.

        NetworkXError
            If `start` is not in `G`.

        Notes
        -----
        Except for `start`, the immediate dominators are the parents of their
        corresponding nodes in the dominator tree.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5)])
        >>> sorted(nx.immediate_dominators(G, 1).items())
        [(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1)]
