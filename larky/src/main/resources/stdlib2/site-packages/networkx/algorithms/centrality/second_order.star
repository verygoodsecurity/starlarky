def second_order_centrality(G):
    """
    Compute the second order centrality for nodes of G.

        The second order centrality of a given node is the standard deviation of
        the return times to that node of a perpetual random walk on G:

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : graph
          A NetworkX connected and undirected graph.

        Returns
        -------
        nodes : dictionary
           Dictionary keyed by node with second order centrality as the value.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.star_graph(10)
        >>> soc = nx.second_order_centrality(G)
        >>> print(sorted(soc.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0][0])  # pick first id
        0

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXException
            If the graph G is empty, non connected or has negative weights.

        Notes
        -----
        Lower values of second order centrality indicate higher centrality.

        The algorithm is from Kermarrec, Le Merrer, Sericola and Trédan [1]_.

        This code implements the analytical version of the algorithm, i.e.,
        there is no simulation of a random walk process involved. The random walk
        is here unbiased (corresponding to eq 6 of the paper [1]_), thus the
        centrality values are the standard deviations for random walk return times
        on the transformed input graph G (equal in-degree at each nodes by adding
        self-loops).

        Complexity of this implementation, made to run locally on a single machine,
        is O(n^3), with n the size of G, which makes it viable only for small
        graphs.
