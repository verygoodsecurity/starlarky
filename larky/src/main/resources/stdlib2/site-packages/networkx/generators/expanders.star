def margulis_gabber_galil_graph(n, create_using=None):
    """
    r"""Returns the Margulis-Gabber-Galil undirected MultiGraph on `n^2` nodes.

        The undirected MultiGraph is regular with degree `8`. Nodes are integer
        pairs. The second-largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph
        is at most `5 \sqrt{2}`, regardless of `n`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Determines the number of nodes in the graph: `n^2`.
        create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default MultiGraph)
           Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

        Returns
        -------
        G : graph
            The constructed undirected multigraph.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            If the graph is directed or not a multigraph.

    
    """
def chordal_cycle_graph(p, create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the chordal cycle graph on `p` nodes.

        The returned graph is a cycle graph on `p` nodes with chords joining each
        vertex `x` to its inverse modulo `p`. This graph is a (mildly explicit)
        3-regular expander [1]_.

        `p` *must* be a prime number.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p : a prime number

            The number of vertices in the graph. This also indicates where the
            chordal edges in the cycle will be created.

        create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
           Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

        Returns
        -------
        G : graph
            The constructed undirected multigraph.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError

            If `create_using` indicates directed or not a multigraph.

    """
def paley_graph(p, create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the Paley (p-1)/2-regular graph on p nodes.

        The returned graph is a graph on Z/pZ with edges between x and y
        if and only if x-y is a nonzero square in Z/pZ.

        If p = 1 mod 4, -1 is a square in Z/pZ and therefore x-y is a square if and
        only if y-x is also a square, i.e the edges in the Paley graph are symmetric.

        If p = 3 mod 4, -1 is not a square in Z/pZ and therefore either x-y or y-x
        is a square in Z/pZ but not both.

        Note that a more general definition of Paley graphs extends this construction
        to graphs over q=p^n vertices, by using the finite field F_q instead of Z/pZ.
        This construction requires to compute squares in general finite fields and is
        not what is implemented here (i.e paley_graph(25) does not return the true
        Paley graph associated with 5^2).

        Parameters
        ----------
        p : int, an odd prime number.

        create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
           Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

        Returns
        -------
        G : graph
            The constructed directed graph.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            If the graph is a multigraph.
