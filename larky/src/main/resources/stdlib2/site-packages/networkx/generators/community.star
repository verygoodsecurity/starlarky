    """
    r"""Returns the LFR benchmark graph.

        This algorithm proceeds as follows:

        1) Find a degree sequence with a power law distribution, and minimum
           value ``min_degree``, which has approximate average degree
           ``average_degree``. This is accomplished by either

           a) specifying ``min_degree`` and not ``average_degree``,
           b) specifying ``average_degree`` and not ``min_degree``, in which
              case a suitable minimum degree will be found.

           ``max_degree`` can also be specified, otherwise it will be set to
           ``n``. Each node *u* will have `\mu \mathrm{deg}(u)` edges
           joining it to nodes in communities other than its own and `(1 -
           \mu) \mathrm{deg}(u)` edges joining it to nodes in its own
           community.
        2) Generate community sizes according to a power law distribution
           with exponent ``tau2``. If ``min_community`` and
           ``max_community`` are not specified they will be selected to be
           ``min_degree`` and ``max_degree``, respectively.  Community sizes
           are generated until the sum of their sizes equals ``n``.
        3) Each node will be randomly assigned a community with the
           condition that the community is large enough for the node's
           intra-community degree, `(1 - \mu) \mathrm{deg}(u)` as
           described in step 2. If a community grows too large, a random node
           will be selected for reassignment to a new community, until all
           nodes have been assigned a community.
        4) Each node *u* then adds `(1 - \mu) \mathrm{deg}(u)`
           intra-community edges and `\mu \mathrm{deg}(u)` inter-community
           edges.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Number of nodes in the created graph.

        tau1 : float
            Power law exponent for the degree distribution of the created
            graph. This value must be strictly greater than one.

        tau2 : float
            Power law exponent for the community size distribution in the
            created graph. This value must be strictly greater than one.

        mu : float
            Fraction of intra-community edges incident to each node. This
            value must be in the interval [0, 1].

        average_degree : float
            Desired average degree of nodes in the created graph. This value
            must be in the interval [0, *n*]. Exactly one of this and
            ``min_degree`` must be specified, otherwise a
            :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

        min_degree : int
            Minimum degree of nodes in the created graph. This value must be
            in the interval [0, *n*]. Exactly one of this and
            ``average_degree`` must be specified, otherwise a
            :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

        max_degree : int
            Maximum degree of nodes in the created graph. If not specified,
            this is set to ``n``, the total number of nodes in the graph.

        min_community : int
            Minimum size of communities in the graph. If not specified, this
            is set to ``min_degree``.

        max_community : int
            Maximum size of communities in the graph. If not specified, this
            is set to ``n``, the total number of nodes in the graph.

        tol : float
            Tolerance when comparing floats, specifically when comparing
            average degree values.

        max_iters : int
            Maximum number of iterations to try to create the community sizes,
            degree distribution, and community affiliations.

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        G : NetworkX graph
            The LFR benchmark graph generated according to the specified
            parameters.

            Each node in the graph has a node attribute ``'community'`` that
            stores the community (that is, the set of nodes) that includes
            it.

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            If any of the parameters do not meet their upper and lower bounds:

            - ``tau1`` and ``tau2`` must be strictly greater than 1.
            - ``mu`` must be in [0, 1].
            - ``max_degree`` must be in {1, ..., *n*}.
            - ``min_community`` and ``max_community`` must be in {0, ...,
              *n*}.

            If not exactly one of ``average_degree`` and ``min_degree`` is
            specified.

            If ``min_degree`` is not specified and a suitable ``min_degree``
            cannot be found.

        ExceededMaxIterations
            If a valid degree sequence cannot be created within
            ``max_iters`` number of iterations.

            If a valid set of community sizes cannot be created within
            ``max_iters`` number of iterations.

            If a valid community assignment cannot be created within ``10 *
            n * max_iters`` number of iterations.

        Examples
        --------
        Basic usage::

            >>> from networkx.generators.community import LFR_benchmark_graph
            >>> n = 250
            >>> tau1 = 3
            >>> tau2 = 1.5
            >>> mu = 0.1
            >>> G = LFR_benchmark_graph(
            ...     n, tau1, tau2, mu, average_degree=5, min_community=20, seed=10
            ... )

        Continuing the example above, you can get the communities from the
        node attributes of the graph::

            >>> communities = {frozenset(G.nodes[v]["community"]) for v in G}

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm differs slightly from the original way it was
        presented in [1].

        1) Rather than connecting the graph via a configuration model then
           rewiring to match the intra-community and inter-community
           degrees, we do this wiring explicitly at the end, which should be
           equivalent.
        2) The code posted on the author's website [2] calculates the random
           power law distributed variables and their average using
           continuous approximations, whereas we use the discrete
           distributions here as both degree and community size are
           discrete.

        Though the authors describe the algorithm as quite robust, testing
        during development indicates that a somewhat narrower parameter set
        is likely to successfully produce a graph. Some suggestions have
        been provided in the event of exceptions.
