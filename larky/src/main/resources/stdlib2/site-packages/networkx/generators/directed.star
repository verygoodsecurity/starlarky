def gn_graph(n, kernel=None, create_using=None, seed=None):
    """
    Returns the growing network (GN) digraph with `n` nodes.

        The GN graph is built by adding nodes one at a time with a link to one
        previously added node.  The target node for the link is chosen with
        probability based on degree.  The default attachment kernel is a linear
        function of the degree of a node.

        The graph is always a (directed) tree.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The number of nodes for the generated graph.
        kernel : function
            The attachment kernel.
        create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default DiGraph)
            Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Examples
        --------
        To create the undirected GN graph, use the :meth:`~DiGraph.to_directed`
        method::

        >>> D = nx.gn_graph(10)  # the GN graph
        >>> G = D.to_undirected()  # the undirected version

        To specify an attachment kernel, use the `kernel` keyword argument::

        >>> D = nx.gn_graph(10, kernel=lambda x: x ** 1.5)  # A_k = k^1.5

    Returns a random `k`-out graph with uniform attachment.

        A random `k`-out graph with uniform attachment is a multidigraph
        generated by the following algorithm. For each node *u*, choose
        `k` nodes *v* uniformly at random (with replacement). Add a
        directed edge joining *u* to *v*.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The number of nodes in the returned graph.

        k : int
            The out-degree of each node in the returned graph.

        self_loops : bool
            If True, self-loops are allowed when generating the graph.

        with_replacement : bool
            If True, neighbors are chosen with replacement and the
            returned graph will be a directed multigraph. Otherwise,
            neighbors are chosen without replacement and the returned graph
            will be a directed graph.

        -------
        NetworkX graph
            A `k`-out-regular directed graph generated according to the
            above algorithm. It will be a multigraph if and only if
            `with_replacement` is True.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `with_replacement` is False and `k` is greater than
            `n`.

        Notes
        -----
        The return digraph or multidigraph may not be strongly connected, or
        even weakly connected.

        If `with_replacement` is True, this function is similar to
        :func:`random_k_out_graph`, if that function had parameter `alpha`

            Returns a random `k`-out graph with preferential attachment.

                A random `k`-out graph with preferential attachment is a
                multidigraph generated by the following algorithm.

                1. Begin with an empty digraph, and initially set each node to have
                   weight `alpha`.
                2. Choose a node `u` with out-degree less than `k` uniformly at
                   random.
                3. Choose a node `v` from with probability proportional to its
                   weight.
                4. Add a directed edge from `u` to `v`, and increase the weight
                   of `v` by one.
                5. If each node has out-degree `k`, halt, otherwise repeat from
                   step 2.

                For more information on this model of random graph, see [1].

                Parameters
                ----------
                n : int
                    The number of nodes in the returned graph.

                k : int
                    The out-degree of each node in the returned graph.

                alpha : float
                    A positive :class:`float` representing the initial weight of
                    each vertex. A higher number means that in step 3 above, nodes
                    will be chosen more like a true uniformly random sample, and a
                    lower number means that nodes are more likely to be chosen as
                    their in-degree increases. If this parameter is not positive, a
                    :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

                self_loops : bool
                    If True, self-loops are allowed when generating the graph.

                seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
                    Indicator of random number generation state.
                    See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

                    A `k`-out-regular multidigraph generated according to the above
                    algorithm.

                Raises
                ------
                ValueError
                    If `alpha` is not positive.

                Notes
                -----
                The returned multidigraph may not be strongly connected, or even
