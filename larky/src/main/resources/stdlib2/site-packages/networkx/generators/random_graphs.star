        The $G_{n,p}$ graph algorithm chooses each of the $[n (n - 1)] / 2$
        (undirected) or $n (n - 1)$ (directed) possible edges with probability $p$.

        This algorithm [1]_ runs in $O(n + m)$ time, where `m` is the expected number of
        edges, which equals $p n (n - 1) / 2$. This should be faster than
        :func:`gnp_random_graph` when $p$ is small and the expected number of edges

        An extended Barabási–Albert model graph is a random graph constructed

        1) With $p$ probability, $m$ new edges are added to the graph,
        starting from randomly chosen existing nodes and attached preferentially at the other end.

        2) With $q$ probability, $m$ existing edges are rewired

        3) With $(1 - p - q)$ probability, $m$ new nodes are added to the graph

        Notes
        -----
        The average clustering has a hard time getting above a certain
        cutoff that depends on `m`.  This cutoff is often quite low.  The
        transitivity (fraction of triangles to possible triangles) seems to
        decrease with network size.

        It is essentially the Barabási–Albert (BA) growth model with an
        extra step that each random edge is followed by a chance of
        making an edge to one of its neighbors too (and thus a triangle).

        This algorithm improves on BA in the sense that it enables a
        higher average clustering to be attained if desired.

        It seems possible to have a disconnected graph with this algorithm
        since the initial `m` nodes may not be all linked to a new node
        on the first iteration like the BA model.

        Raises

        constructor : list of three-tuples
            Represents the parameters for a shell, starting at the center
            shell.  Each element of the list must be of the form `(n, m,
            d)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the shell, `m` is
            the number of edges in the shell, and `d` is the ratio of
            inter-shell (next) edges to intra-shell edges. If `d` is zero,
            there will be no intra-shell edges, and if `d` is one there
            will be all possible intra-shell edges.
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> constructor = [(10, 20, 0.8), (20, 40, 0.8)]
        >>> G = nx.random_shell_graph(constructor)

def random_kernel_graph(n, kernel_integral, kernel_root=None, seed=None):
    """
    r"""Returns an random graph based on the specified kernel.

        The algorithm chooses each of the $[n(n-1)]/2$ possible edges with
        probability specified by a kernel $\kappa(x,y)$ [1]_.  The kernel
        $\kappa(x,y)$ must be a symmetric (in $x,y$), non-negative,
        bounded function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The number of nodes
        kernal_integral : function
            Function that returns the definite integral of the kernel $\kappa(x,y)$,
            $F(y,a,b) := \int_a^b \kappa(x,y)dx$
        kernel_root: function (optional)
            Function that returns the root $b$ of the equation $F(y,a,b) = r$.
            If None, the root is found using :func:`scipy.optimize.brentq`
            (this requires SciPy).
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Notes
        -----
        The kernel is specified through its definite integral which must be
        provided as one of the arguments. If the integral and root of the
        kernel integral can be found in $O(1)$ time then this algorithm runs in
        time $O(n+m)$ where m is the expected number of edges [2]_.

        The nodes are set to integers from $0$ to $n-1$.

        Examples
        --------
        Generate an Erdős–Rényi random graph $G(n,c/n)$, with kernel
        $\kappa(x,y)=c$ where $c$ is the mean expected degree.

        >>> def integral(u, w, z):
        ...     return c * (z - w)
        >>> def root(u, w, r):
        ...     return r / c + w
        >>> c = 1
        >>> graph = nx.random_kernel_graph(1000, integral, root)
