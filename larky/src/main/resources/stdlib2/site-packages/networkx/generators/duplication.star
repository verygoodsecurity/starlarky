def partial_duplication_graph(N, n, p, q, seed=None):
    """
    Returns a random graph using the partial duplication model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        N : int
            The total number of nodes in the final graph.

        n : int
            The number of nodes in the initial clique.

        p : float
            The probability of joining each neighbor of a node to the
            duplicate node. Must be a number in the between zero and one,
            inclusive.

        q : float
            The probability of joining the source node to the duplicate
            node. Must be a number in the between zero and one, inclusive.

        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Notes
        -----
        A graph of nodes is grown by creating a fully connected graph
        of size `n`. The following procedure is then repeated until
        a total of `N` nodes have been reached.

        1. A random node, *u*, is picked and a new node, *v*, is created.
        2. For each neighbor of *u* an edge from the neighbor to *v* is created
           with probability `p`.
        3. An edge from *u* to *v* is created with probability `q`.

        This algorithm appears in [1].

        This implementation allows the possibility of generating
        disconnected graphs.

def duplication_divergence_graph(n, p, seed=None):
    """
    Returns an undirected graph using the duplication-divergence model.

        A graph of `n` nodes is created by duplicating the initial nodes
        and retaining edges incident to the original nodes with a retention
        probability `p`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The desired number of nodes in the graph.
        p : float
            The probability for retaining the edge of the replicated node.
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.

        Returns
        -------
        G : Graph

        Raises
        ------
        NetworkXError
            If `p` is not a valid probability.
            If `n` is less than 2.

        Notes

        This algorithm appears in [1].

        This implementation disallows the possibility of generating
        disconnected graphs.
