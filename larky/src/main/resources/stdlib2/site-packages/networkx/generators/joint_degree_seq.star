def is_valid_joint_degree(joint_degrees):
    """
     Checks whether the given joint degree dictionary is realizable.

        A *joint degree dictionary* is a dictionary of dictionaries, in
        which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` is an integer representing the
        number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of degree
        *l*. Such a dictionary is realizable as a simple graph if and only
        if the following conditions are satisfied.

        - each entry must be an integer,
        - the total number of nodes of degree *k*, computed by
          ``sum(joint_degrees[k].values()) / k``, must be an integer,
        - the total number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with
          nodes of degree *l* cannot exceed the total number of possible edges,
        - each diagonal entry ``joint_degrees[k][k]`` must be even (this is
          a convention assumed by the :func:`joint_degree_graph` function).


        Parameters
        ----------
        joint_degrees :  dictionary of dictionary of integers
            A joint degree dictionary in which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]``
            is the number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of
            degree *l*.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether the given joint degree dictionary is realizable as a
            simple graph.

def _neighbor_switch(G, w, unsat, h_node_residual, avoid_node_id=None):

     Releases one free stub for ``w``, while preserving joint degree in G.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : NetworkX graph
            Graph in which the neighbor switch will take place.
        w : integer
            Node id for which we will execute this neighbor switch.

        Notes
        -----
        First, it selects *w_prime*, an  unsaturated node that has the same degree
        as ``w``. Second, it selects *switch_node*, a neighbor node of ``w`` that
        is not  connected to *w_prime*. Then it executes an edge swap i.e. removes
        (``w``,*switch_node*) and adds (*w_prime*,*switch_node*). Gjoka et. al. [1]
        prove that such an edge swap is always possible.

        Parameters
        ----------
        joint_degrees :  dictionary of dictionary of integers
            A joint degree dictionary in which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` is the
            number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of degree *l*.

        In each iteration of the "while loop" the algorithm picks two disconnected
        nodes *v* and *w*, of degree *k* and *l* correspondingly,  for which
        ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` has not reached its target yet. It then adds
        edge (*v*, *w*) and increases the number of edges in graph G by one.

        The intelligence of the algorithm lies in the fact that  it is always
        possible to add an edge between such disconnected nodes *v* and *w*,
        even if one or both nodes do not have free stubs. That is made possible by
        executing a "neighbor switch", an edge rewiring move that releases
        a free stub while keeping the joint degree of G the same.

        The algorithm continues for E (number of edges) iterations of
        the "while loop", at the which point all entries of the given
        ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` have reached their target values and the
        construction is complete.

        First, it selects node w_prime that (1) has the same degree as w and
        (2) is unsaturated. Then, it selects node v, a neighbor of w, that is
        not connected to w_prime and does an edge swap i.e. removes (w,v) and
        adds (w_prime,v). If neighbor switch is not possible for w using
        w_prime and v, then return w_prime; in [1] it's proven that
        such unsaturated nodes can be used.

        Notes
        -----
        Similarly to the undirected version:
        In each iteration of the "while loop" the algorithm picks two disconnected
        nodes v and w, of degree k and l correspondingly,  for which nkk[k][l] has
        not reached its target yet i.e. (for given k,l): n_edges_add < nkk[k][l].
        It then adds edge (v,w) and always increases the number of edges in graph G
        by one.

        The intelligence of the algorithm lies in the fact that  it is always
        possible to add an edge between disconnected nodes v and w, for which
        nkk[degree(v)][degree(w)] has not reached its target, even if one or both
        nodes do not have free stubs. If either node v or w does not have a free
        stub, we perform a "neighbor switch", an edge rewiring move that releases a
        free stub while keeping nkk the same.

        The difference for the directed version lies in the fact that neighbor
        switches might not be able to rewire, but in these cases unsaturated nodes
        can be reassigned to use instead, see [1] for detailed description and
        proofs.

        The algorithm continues for E (number of edges in the graph) iterations of
        the "while loop", at which point all entries of the given nkk[k][l] have
        reached their target values and the construction is complete.
