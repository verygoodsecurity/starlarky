def random_cograph(n, seed=None):
    """
    r"""Returns a random cograph with $2 ^ n$ nodes.

        A cograph is a graph containing no path on four vertices.
        Cographs or $P_4$-free graphs can be obtained from a single vertex
        by disjoint union and complementation operations.

        This generator starts off from a single vertex and performes disjoint
        union and full join operations on itself.
        The decision on which operation will take place is random.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
                The order of the cograph.
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        G : A random graph containing no path on four vertices.
