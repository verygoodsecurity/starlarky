                The process steps are the following: first we create the core network
                of tier one nodes, then we add the middle tier (M), the content
                provider (CP) and the customer (C) nodes along with their transit edges
                (link i,j means i is customer of j). Finally we add peering links
                between M nodes, between M and CP nodes and between CP node couples.

        This algorithm returns an undirected graph resembling the Internet
        Autonomous System (AS) network, it uses the approach by Elmokashfi et al.
        [1] and it grants the properties described in the related paper [1].

        Each node models an autonomous system, with an attribute 'type' specifying
        its kind; tier-1 (T), mid-level (M), customer (C) or content-provider (CP).
        Each edge models an ADV communication link (hence, bidirectional) with
        attributes:
            - type: transit|peer, the kind of commercial agreement between nodes;
            - customer: <node id>, the identifier of the node acting as customer
                ('none' if type is peer).
