def interval_graph(intervals):
    """
     Generates an interval graph for a list of intervals given.

        In graph theory, an interval graph is an undirected graph formed from a set
        of closed intervals on the real line, with a vertex for each interval
        and an edge between vertices whose intervals intersect.
        It is the intersection graph of the intervals.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_graph

        Parameters
        ----------
        intervals : a sequence of intervals, say (l, r) where l is the left end,
        and r is the right end of the closed interval.

        Returns
        -------
        G : networkx graph

        Examples
        --------
        >>> intervals = [(-2, 3), [1, 4], (2, 3), (4, 6)]
        >>> G = nx.interval_graph(intervals)
        >>> sorted(G.edges)
        [((-2, 3), (1, 4)), ((-2, 3), (2, 3)), ((1, 4), (2, 3)), ((1, 4), (4, 6))]

        Raises
        --------
        :exc:`TypeError`
            if `intervals` contains None or an element which is not
            collections.abc.Sequence or not a length of 2.
        :exc:`ValueError`
            if `intervals` contains an interval such that min1 > max1
            where min1,max1 = interval
