def hnm_harary_graph(n, m, create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the Harary graph with given numbers of nodes and edges.

        The Harary graph $H_{n,m}$ is the graph that maximizes node connectivity
        with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.

        This maximum node connectivity is known to be floor($2m/n$). [1]_

        Parameters
        ----------
        n: integer
           The number of nodes the generated graph is to contain

        m: integer
           The number of edges the generated graph is to contain

        create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional Graph type
         to create (default=nx.Graph). If graph instance, then cleared
         before populated.

        Returns
        -------
        NetworkX graph
            The Harary graph $H_{n,m}$.

        Notes
        -----
        This algorithm runs in $O(m)$ time.
        It is implemented by following the Reference [2]_.
