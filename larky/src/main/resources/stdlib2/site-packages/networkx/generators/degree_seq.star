def _to_stublist(degree_sequence):
    """
    Returns a list of degree-repeated node numbers.

        ``degree_sequence`` is a list of nonnegative integers representing
        the degrees of nodes in a graph.

        This function returns a list of node numbers with multiplicities
        according to the given degree sequence. For example, if the first
        element of ``degree_sequence`` is ``3``, then the first node number,
        ``0``, will appear at the head of the returned list three times. The
        node numbers are assumed to be the numbers zero through
        ``len(degree_sequence) - 1``.

        >>> degree_sequence = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> _to_stublist(degree_sequence)

        If a zero appears in the sequence, that means the node exists but
        has degree zero, so that number will be skipped in the returned

        >>> degree_sequence = [2, 0, 1]

        As described by Newman [1]_.

        A non-graphical degree sequence (not realizable by some simple
        graph) is allowed since this function returns graphs with self
        loops and parallel edges.  An exception is raised if the degree
        sequence does not have an even sum.

        This configuration model construction process can lead to
        duplicate edges and loops.  You can remove the self-loops and
        parallel edges (see below) which will likely result in a graph
        that doesn't have the exact degree sequence specified.

        The density of self-loops and parallel edges tends to decrease as
        the number of nodes increases. However, typically the number of
        self-loops will approach a Poisson distribution with a nonzero mean,
        and similarly for the number of parallel edges.  Consider a node
        with *k* stubs. The probability of being joined to another stub of
        the same node is basically (*k* - *1*) / *N*, where *k* is the
        degree and *N* is the number of nodes. So the probability of a
        self-loop scales like *c* / *N* for some constant *c*. As *N* grows,
        this means we expect *c* self-loops. Similarly for parallel edges.

        with degree sequence chosen from the power law distribution:

        Examples
        --------
        One can modify the in- and out-degree sequences from an existing
        directed graph in order to create a new directed graph. For example,
        here we modify the directed path graph:

        >>> D = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)])
        >>> din = list(d for n, d in D.in_degree())
        >>> dout = list(d for n, d in D.out_degree())
        >>> din.append(1)

        >>> # We now expect an edge from node 0 to a new node, node 3.
        ... D = nx.directed_configuration_model(din, dout)

        Notes
        -----
        The nodes have integer labels corresponding to index of expected degrees
        input sequence.

        The complexity of this algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$ where $n$ is the
        number of nodes and $m$ is the expected number of edges.

        The model in [1]_ includes the possibility of self-loop edges.
        Set selfloops=False to produce a graph without self loops.

        For finite graphs this model doesn't produce exactly the given
        expected degree sequence.  Instead the expected degrees are as
        follows.

        For the case without self loops (selfloops=False),

        .. math::

           E[deg(u)] = \sum_{v \ne u} p_{uv}
                    = w_u \left( 1 - \frac{w_u}{\sum_k w_k} \right) .


        NetworkX uses the standard convention that a self-loop edge counts 2
        in the degree of a node, so with self loops (selfloops=True),

        .. math::

           E[deg(u)] =  \sum_{v \ne u} p_{uv}  + 2 p_{uu}
                    = w_u \left( 1 + \frac{w_u}{\sum_k w_k} \right) .

        The Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs a simple graph by

        repeating the process. The resulting graph has a high
