def powerlaw_sequence(n, exponent=2.0, seed=None):

        Return sample sequence of length n from a power law distribution.

    r"""Returns a random value chosen from the Zipf distribution.

        The return value is an integer drawn from the probability distribution

        .. math::

            p(x)=\frac{x^{-\alpha}}{\zeta(\alpha, x_{\min})},

        where $\zeta(\alpha, x_{\min})$ is the Hurwitz zeta function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : float
          Exponent value of the distribution
        xmin : int
          Minimum value
        seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
            Indicator of random number generation state.
            See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

        Returns
        -------
        x : int
          Random value from Zipf distribution

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError:
          If xmin < 1 or
          If alpha <= 1

        Notes
        -----
        The rejection algorithm generates random values for a the power-law
        distribution in uniformly bounded expected time dependent on
        parameters.  See [1]_ for details on its operation.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> nx.utils.zipf_rv(alpha=2, xmin=3, seed=42)
        8
