def UnionFind:

    Union-find data structure.

        Each unionFind instance X maintains a family of disjoint sets of
        hashable objects, supporting the following two methods:

        - X[item] returns a name for the set containing the given item.
          Each set is named by an arbitrarily-chosen one of its members; as
          long as the set remains unchanged it will keep the same name. If
          the item is not yet part of a set in X, a new singleton set is
          created for it.

        - X.union(item1, item2, ...) merges the sets containing each item
          into a single larger set.  If any item is not yet part of a set
          in X, it is added to X as one of the members of the merged set.

          Union-find data structure. Based on Josiah Carlson's code,
          http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/215912
