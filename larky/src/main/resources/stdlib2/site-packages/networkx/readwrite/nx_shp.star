def read_shp(path, simplify=True, geom_attrs=True, strict=True):
    """
    Generates a networkx.DiGraph from shapefiles. Point geometries are
        translated into nodes, lines into edges. Coordinate tuples are used as
        keys. Attributes are preserved, line geometries are simplified into start
        and end coordinates. Accepts a single shapefile or directory of many
        shapefiles.

        "The Esri Shapefile or simply a shapefile is a popular geospatial vector
        data format for geographic information systems software [1]_."

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : file or string
           File, directory, or filename to read.

        simplify:  bool
            If True, simplify line geometries to start and end coordinates.
            If False, and line feature geometry has multiple segments, the
            non-geometric attributes for that feature will be repeated for each
            edge comprising that feature.

        geom_attrs: bool
            If True, include the Wkb, Wkt and Json geometry attributes with
            each edge.

            NOTE:  if these attributes are available, write_shp will use them
            to write the geometry.  If nodes store the underlying coordinates for
            the edge geometry as well (as they do when they are read via
            this method) and they change, your geomety will be out of sync.

        strict: bool
            If True, raise NetworkXError when feature geometry is missing or
            GeometryType is not supported.
            If False, silently ignore missing or unsupported geometry in features.

        Returns
        -------
        G : NetworkX graph

        Raises
        ------
        ImportError
           If ogr module is not available.

        RuntimeError
           If file cannot be open or read.

        NetworkXError
           If strict=True and feature is missing geometry or GeometryType is
           not supported.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.read_shp("test.shp")  # doctest: +SKIP

def edges_from_line(geom, attrs, simplify=True, geom_attrs=True):
    """

        Generate edges for each line in geom
        Written as a helper for read_shp

        Parameters
        ----------

        geom:  ogr line geometry
            To be converted into an edge or edges

        attrs:  dict
            Attributes to be associated with all geoms

        simplify:  bool
            If True, simplify the line as in read_shp

        geom_attrs:  bool
            If True, add geom attributes to edge as in read_shp


        Returns
        -------
         edges:  generator of edges
            each edge is a tuple of form
            (node1_coord, node2_coord, attribute_dict)
            suitable for expanding into a networkx Graph add_edge call
    
    """
def write_shp(G, outdir):
    """
    Writes a networkx.DiGraph to two shapefiles, edges and nodes.
        Nodes and edges are expected to have a Well Known Binary (Wkb) or
        Well Known Text (Wkt) key in order to generate geometries. Also
        acceptable are nodes with a numeric tuple key (x,y).
