def _generate_graph6_bytes(G, nodes, header):
    """
    Yield bytes in the graph6 encoding of a graph.

        `G` is an undirected simple graph. `nodes` is the list of nodes for
        which the node-induced subgraph will be encoded; if `nodes` is the
        list of all nodes in the graph, the entire graph will be
        encoded. `header` is a Boolean that specifies whether to generate
        the header ``b'>>graph6<<'`` before the remaining data.

        This function generates `bytes` objects in the following order:

        1. the header (if requested),
        2. the encoding of the number of nodes,
        3. each character, one-at-a-time, in the encoding of the requested
           node-induced subgraph,
        4. a newline character.

        This function raises :exc:`ValueError` if the graph is too large for
        the graph6 format (that is, greater than ``2 ** 36`` nodes).

    
    """
