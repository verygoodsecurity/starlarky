    dir2(obj) -> list of strings

        Extended version of the Python builtin dir(), which does a few extra
        checks.

        This version is guaranteed to return only a list of true strings, whereas
        dir() returns anything that objects inject into themselves, even if they
        are later not really valid for attribute access (many extension libraries
        have such bugs).

    Like getattr, but with a few extra sanity checks:

        - If obj is a class, ignore everything except class methods
        - Check if obj is a proxy that claims to have all attributes
        - Catch attribute access failing with any exception
        - Check that the attribute is a callable object

        Returns the method or None.
