        Asks a question and returns a boolean (y/n) answer.

            If default is given (one of 'y','n'), it is used if the user input is
            empty. If interrupt is given (one of 'y','n'), it is used if the user
            presses Ctrl-C. Otherwise the question is repeated until an answer is
            given.

            An EOF is treated as the default answer.  If there is no default, an
            exception is raised to prevent infinite loops.

            Valid answers are: y/yes/n/no (match is not case sensitive).

          Source code to be written to the file.
