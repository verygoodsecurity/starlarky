                function.

                The given statement (which doesn't require quote marks) is run via the
                python profiler in a manner similar to the profile.run() function.
                Namespaces are internally managed to work correctly; profile.run
                cannot be used in IPython because it makes certain assumptions about
                namespaces which do not hold under IPython.

                Options:

                -l <limit>
                  you can place restrictions on what or how much of the
                  profile gets printed. The limit value can be:

                     * A string: only information for function names containing this string
                       is printed.

                     * An integer: only these many lines are printed.

                     * A float (between 0 and 1): this fraction of the report is printed
                       (for example, use a limit of 0.4 to see the topmost 40% only).

                  You can combine several limits with repeated use of the option. For
                  example, ``-l __init__ -l 5`` will print only the topmost 5 lines of
                  information about class constructors.

                -r
                  return the pstats.Stats object generated by the profiling. This
                  object has all the information about the profile in it, and you can
                  later use it for further analysis or in other functions.

                -s <key>
                  sort profile by given key. You can provide more than one key
                  by using the option several times: '-s key1 -s key2 -s key3...'. The
                  default sorting key is 'time'.

                  The following is copied verbatim from the profile documentation
                  referenced below:

                  When more than one key is provided, additional keys are used as
                  secondary criteria when the there is equality in all keys selected
                  before them.

                  Abbreviations can be used for any key names, as long as the
                  abbreviation is unambiguous.  The following are the keys currently
                  defined:

                  ============  =====================
                  Valid Arg     Meaning
                  ============  =====================
                  "calls"       call count
                  "cumulative"  cumulative time
                  "file"        file name
                  "module"      file name
                  "pcalls"      primitive call count
                  "line"        line number
                  "name"        function name
                  "nfl"         name/file/line
                  "stdname"     standard name
                  "time"        internal time
                  ============  =====================

                  Note that all sorts on statistics are in descending order (placing
                  most time consuming items first), where as name, file, and line number
                  searches are in ascending order (i.e., alphabetical). The subtle
                  distinction between "nfl" and "stdname" is that the standard name is a
                  sort of the name as printed, which means that the embedded line
                  numbers get compared in an odd way.  For example, lines 3, 20, and 40
                  would (if the file names were the same) appear in the string order
                  "20" "3" and "40".  In contrast, "nfl" does a numeric compare of the
                  line numbers.  In fact, sort_stats("nfl") is the same as
                  sort_stats("name", "file", "line").

                -T <filename>
                  save profile results as shown on screen to a text
                  file. The profile is still shown on screen.

                -D <filename>
                  save (via dump_stats) profile statistics to given
                  filename. This data is in a format understood by the pstats module, and
                  is generated by a call to the dump_stats() method of profile
                  objects. The profile is still shown on screen.

                -q
                  suppress output to the pager.  Best used with -T and/or -D above.

                If you want to run complete programs under the profiler's control, use
                ``%run -p [prof_opts] filename.py [args to program]`` where prof_opts

                argument it works as a toggle.

                When an exception is triggered, IPython can optionally call the
                interactive pdb debugger after the traceback printout. %pdb toggles
                this feature on and off.

                The initial state of this feature is set in your configuration

                This magic command support two ways of activating debugger.
                One is to activate debugger before executing code.  This way, you
                can set a break point, to step through the code from the point.
                You can use this mode by giving statements to execute and optionally
                a breakpoint.

                The other one is to activate debugger in post-mortem mode.  You can
                activate this mode simply running %debug without any argument.
                If an exception has just occurred, this lets you inspect its stack
                frames interactively.  Note that this will always work only on the last
                traceback that occurred, so you must call this quickly after an
                exception that you wish to inspect has fired, because if another one
                occurs, it clobbers the previous one.

                If you want IPython to automatically do this on every exception, see

                Parameters after the filename are passed as command-line arguments to
                the program (put in sys.argv). Then, control returns to IPython's
                prompt.

                This is similar to running at a system prompt ``python file args``,
                but with the advantage of giving you IPython's tracebacks, and of
                loading all variables into your interactive namespace for further use
                (unless -p is used, see below).

                The file is executed in a namespace initially consisting only of
                ``__name__=='__main__'`` and sys.argv constructed as indicated. It thus
                sees its environment as if it were being run as a stand-alone program
                (except for sharing global objects such as previously imported
                modules). But after execution, the IPython interactive namespace gets
                updated with all variables defined in the program (except for __name__
                and sys.argv). This allows for very convenient loading of code for
                interactive work, while giving each program a 'clean sheet' to run in.

                Arguments are expanded using shell-like glob match.  Patterns
                '*', '?', '[seq]' and '[!seq]' can be used.  Additionally,
                tilde '~' will be expanded into user's home directory.  Unlike
                real shells, quotation does not suppress expansions.  Use
                *two* back slashes (e.g. ``\\\\*``) to suppress expansions.
                To completely disable these expansions, you can use -G flag.

                On Windows systems, the use of single quotes `'` when specifying 
                a file is not supported. Use double quotes `"`.

                Options:

                -n
                  __name__ is NOT set to '__main__', but to the running file's name
                  without extension (as python does under import).  This allows running
                  scripts and reloading the definitions in them without calling code
                  protected by an ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` clause.

                -i
                  run the file in IPython's namespace instead of an empty one. This
                  is useful if you are experimenting with code written in a text editor
                  which depends on variables defined interactively.

                -e
                  ignore sys.exit() calls or SystemExit exceptions in the script
                  being run.  This is particularly useful if IPython is being used to
                  run unittests, which always exit with a sys.exit() call.  In such
                  cases you are interested in the output of the test results, not in
                  seeing a traceback of the unittest module.

                -t
                  print timing information at the end of the run.  IPython will give
                  you an estimated CPU time consumption for your script, which under
                  Unix uses the resource module to avoid the wraparound problems of
                  time.clock().  Under Unix, an estimate of time spent on system tasks
                  is also given (for Windows platforms this is reported as 0.0).

                If -t is given, an additional ``-N<N>`` option can be given, where <N>
                must be an integer indicating how many times you want the script to
                run.  The final timing report will include total and per run results.

                For example (testing the script uniq_stable.py)::

                    In [1]: run -t uniq_stable

                    IPython CPU timings (estimated):
                      User  :    0.19597 s.
                      System:        0.0 s.

                    In [2]: run -t -N5 uniq_stable

                    IPython CPU timings (estimated):
                    Total runs performed: 5
                      Times :      Total       Per run
                      User  :   0.910862 s,  0.1821724 s.
                      System:        0.0 s,        0.0 s.

                -d
                  run your program under the control of pdb, the Python debugger.
                  This allows you to execute your program step by step, watch variables,
                  etc.  Internally, what IPython does is similar to calling::

                      pdb.run('execfile("YOURFILENAME")')

                  with a breakpoint set on line 1 of your file.  You can change the line
                  number for this automatic breakpoint to be <N> by using the -bN option
                  (where N must be an integer). For example::

                      %run -d -b40 myscript

                  will set the first breakpoint at line 40 in myscript.py.  Note that
                  the first breakpoint must be set on a line which actually does
                  something (not a comment or docstring) for it to stop execution.

                  Or you can specify a breakpoint in a different file::

                      %run -d -b myotherfile.py:20 myscript

                  When the pdb debugger starts, you will see a (Pdb) prompt.  You must
                  first enter 'c' (without quotes) to start execution up to the first
                  breakpoint.

                  Entering 'help' gives information about the use of the debugger.  You
                  can easily see pdb's full documentation with "import pdb;pdb.help()"
                  at a prompt.

                -p
                  run program under the control of the Python profiler module (which
                  prints a detailed report of execution times, function calls, etc).

                  You can pass other options after -p which affect the behavior of the
                  profiler itself. See the docs for %prun for details.

                  In this mode, the program's variables do NOT propagate back to the
                  IPython interactive namespace (because they remain in the namespace
                  where the profiler executes them).

                  Internally this triggers a call to %prun, see its documentation for
                  details on the options available specifically for profiling.

                There is one special usage for which the text above doesn't apply:
                if the filename ends with .ipy[nb], the file is run as ipython script,
                just as if the commands were written on IPython prompt.

                -m
                  specify module name to load instead of script path. Similar to
                  the -m option for the python interpreter. Use this option last if you
                  want to combine with other %run options. Unlike the python interpreter
                  only source modules are allowed no .pyc or .pyo files.
                  For example::

                      %run -m example

                  will run the example module.

                -G
                  disable shell-like glob expansion of arguments.

        Time execution of a Python statement or expression

                Usage, in line mode:
                  %timeit [-n<N> -r<R> [-t|-c] -q -p<P> -o] statement
                or in cell mode:

                Time execution of a Python statement or expression using the timeit
                module.  This function can be used both as a line and cell magic:

                - In line mode you can time a single-line statement (though multiple
                  ones can be chained with using semicolons).

                - In cell mode, the statement in the first line is used as setup code
                  (executed but not timed) and the body of the cell is timed.  The cell
                  body has access to any variables created in the setup code.

                Options:
                -n<N>: execute the given statement <N> times in a loop. If <N> is not
                provided, <N> is determined so as to get sufficient accuracy.

                -r<R>: number of repeats <R>, each consisting of <N> loops, and take the
                best result.
                Default: 7

                -t: use time.time to measure the time, which is the default on Unix.
                This function measures wall time.

                -c: use time.clock to measure the time, which is the default on
                Windows and measures wall time. On Unix, resource.getrusage is used
                instead and returns the CPU user time.

                -p<P>: use a precision of <P> digits to display the timing result.
                Default: 3

                -q: Quiet, do not print result.

                -o: return a TimeitResult that can be stored in a variable to inspect
                    the result in more details.

                  8.26 ns ± 0.12 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000000 loops each)

                  In [6]: %timeit -n1 time.sleep(2)


                The times reported by %timeit will be slightly higher than those
                reported by the timeit.py script when variables are accessed. This is
                due to the fact that %timeit executes the statement in the namespace
                of the shell, compared with timeit.py, which uses a single setup
                statement to import function or create variables. Generally, the bias
                does not matter as long as results from timeit.py are not mixed with
                those from %timeit.

    def macro(self, parameter_s=''):
        """
        Define a macro for future re-execution. It accepts ranges of history,
                filenames or string objects.

                Usage:\\
                  %macro [options] name n1-n2 n3-n4 ... n5 .. n6 ...

                Options:

                  -r: use 'raw' input.  By default, the 'processed' history is used,
                  so that magics are loaded in their transformed version to valid
                  Python.  If this option is given, the raw input as typed at the
                  command line is used instead.
          
                  -q: quiet macro definition.  By default, a tag line is printed 
                  to indicate the macro has been created, and then the contents of 
                  the macro are printed.  If this option is given, then no printout
                  is produced once the macro is created.

                This will define a global variable called `name` which is a string
                made of joining the slices and lines you specify (n1,n2,... numbers
                above) from your input history into a single string. This variable
                acts like an automatic function which re-executes those lines as if
                you had typed them. You just type 'name' at the prompt and the code
                executes.

                The syntax for indicating input ranges is described in %history.

                Note: as a 'hidden' feature, you can also use traditional python slice
                notation, where N:M means numbers N through M-1.

                For example, if your history contains (print using %hist -n )::

                  44: x=1
                  45: y=3
                  46: z=x+y
                  47: print x
                  48: a=5
                  49: print 'x',x,'y',y

                you can create a macro with lines 44 through 47 (included) and line 49
                called my_macro with::

                  In [55]: %macro my_macro 44-47 49

                Now, typing `my_macro` (without quotes) will re-execute all this code
                in one pass.

                You don't need to give the line-numbers in order, and any given line
                number can appear multiple times. You can assemble macros with any
                lines from your input history in any order.

                The macro is a simple object which holds its value in an attribute,
                but IPython's display system checks for macros and executes them as
                code instead of printing them when you type their name.

                You can view a macro's contents by explicitly printing it with::

                  print macro_name
