                This mode is intended to make IPython behave as much as possible like a
                plain Python shell, from the perspective of how its prompts, exceptions
                and output look.  This makes it easy to copy and paste parts of a
                session into doctests.  It does so by:

                - Changing the prompts to the classic ``>>>`` ones.
                - Changing the exception reporting mode to 'Plain'.
                - Disabling pretty-printing of output.

                Note that IPython also supports the pasting of code snippets that have
                leading '>>>' and '...' prompts in them.  This means that you can paste
                doctests from files or docstrings (even if they have leading
                whitespace), and the code will execute correctly.  You can then use
                '%history -t' to see the translated history; this will give you the
                input after removal of all the leading prompts and whitespace, which
                can be pasted back into an editor.

                With these features, you can switch into this mode easily whenever you
                need to do testing and changes to doctests, without having to leave
                your existing IPython session.
