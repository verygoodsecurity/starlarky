    def logstart(self, parameter_s=''):
        """
        Start logging anywhere in a session.

                %logstart [-o|-r|-t|-q] [log_name [log_mode]]

                If no name is given, it defaults to a file named 'ipython_log.py' in your
                current directory, in 'rotate' mode (see below).

                '%logstart name' saves to file 'name' in 'backup' mode.  It saves your
                history up to that point and then continues logging.

                %logstart takes a second optional parameter: logging mode. This can be one
                of (note that the modes are given unquoted):

                append
                    Keep logging at the end of any existing file.

                backup
                    Rename any existing file to name~ and start name.

                global
                    Append to  a single logfile in your home directory.

                over
                    Overwrite any existing log.

                rotate
                    Create rotating logs: name.1~, name.2~, etc.

                Options:

                  -o
                    log also IPython's output. In this mode, all commands which
                    generate an Out[NN] prompt are recorded to the logfile, right after
                    their corresponding input line. The output lines are always
                    prepended with a '#[Out]# ' marker, so that the log remains valid
                    Python code.

                  Since this marker is always the same, filtering only the output from
                  a log is very easy, using for example a simple awk call::

                    awk -F'#\\[Out\\]# ' '{if($2) {print $2}}' ipython_log.py

                  -r
                    log 'raw' input.  Normally, IPython's logs contain the processed
                    input, so that user lines are logged in their final form, converted
                    into valid Python.  For example, %Exit is logged as
                    _ip.magic("Exit").  If the -r flag is given, all input is logged
                    exactly as typed, with no transformations applied.

                  -t
                    put timestamps before each input line logged (these are put in
                    comments).

                  -q 
                    suppress output of logstate message when logging is invoked

    def logstop(self, parameter_s=''):
        """
        Fully stop logging and close log file.

                In order to start logging again, a new %logstart call needs to be made,
                possibly (though not necessarily) with a new filename, mode and other
                options.

    def logoff(self, parameter_s=''):

        Restart logging.

                This function is for restarting logging which you've temporarily
                stopped with %logoff. For starting logging for the first time, you
                must use the %logstart function, which allows you to specify an
                optional log filename.
