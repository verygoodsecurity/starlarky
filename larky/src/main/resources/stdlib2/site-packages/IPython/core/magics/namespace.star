                Arguments:

                  PATTERN

                  where PATTERN is a string containing * as a wildcard similar to its
                  use in a shell.  The pattern is matched in all namespaces on the
                  search path. By default objects starting with a single _ are not
                  matched, many IPython generated objects have a single
                  underscore. The default is case insensitive matching. Matching is
                  also done on the attributes of objects and not only on the objects
                  in a module.

                  [OBJECT TYPE]

                  Is the name of a python type from the types module. The name is
                  given in lowercase without the ending type, ex. StringType is
                  written string. By adding a type here only objects matching the
                  given type are matched. Using all here makes the pattern match all
                  types (this is the default).

                Options:

                  -a: makes the pattern match even objects whose names start with a
                  single underscore.  These names are normally omitted from the
                  search.

                  -i/-c: make the pattern case insensitive/sensitive.  If neither of
                  these options are given, the default is read from your configuration
                  file, with the option ``InteractiveShell.wildcards_case_sensitive``.
                  If this option is not specified in your configuration file, IPython's
                  internal default is to do a case sensitive search.

                  -e/-s NAMESPACE: exclude/search a given namespace.  The pattern you
                  specify can be searched in any of the following namespaces:
                  'builtin', 'user', 'user_global','internal', 'alias', where
                  'builtin' and 'user' are the search defaults.  Note that you should
                  not use quotes when specifying namespaces.
          
                  -l: List all available object types for object matching. This function
                  can be used without arguments.

                  'Builtin' contains the python module builtin, 'user' contains all
                  user data, 'alias' only contain the shell aliases and no python
                  objects, 'internal' contains objects used by IPython.  The
                  'user_global' namespace is only used by embedded IPython instances,
                  and it contains module-level globals.  You can add namespaces to the
                  search with -s or exclude them with -e (these options can be given
                  more than once).

                If any arguments are given, only variables whose type matches one of
                these are printed.  For example::

                  %who function str

                will only list functions and strings, excluding all other types of
                variables.  To find the proper type names, simply use type(var) at a
                command line to see how python prints type names.  For example:

                ::

                  In [1]: type('hello')\\
                  Out[1]: <type 'str'>

                indicates that the type name for strings is 'str'.

                ``%who`` always excludes executed names loaded through your configuration
                file and things which are internal to IPython.

                This is deliberate, as typically you may load many modules and the
                purpose of %who is to show you only what you've manually defined.
