    :param key:
        The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher.
        It must be 8 byte long. The parity bits will be ignored.
    :type key: bytes/bytearray/memoryview

    :param mode:
        The chaining mode to use for encryption or decryption.
    :type mode: One of the supported ``MODE_*`` constants

    :Keyword Arguments:
        *   **iv** (*byte string*) --
            (Only applicable for ``MODE_CBC``, ``MODE_CFB``, ``MODE_OFB``,
            and ``MODE_OPENPGP`` modes).

            The initialization vector to use for encryption or decryption.

            For ``MODE_CBC``, ``MODE_CFB``, and ``MODE_OFB`` it must be 8 bytes long.

            For ``MODE_OPENPGP`` mode only,
            it must be 8 bytes long for encryption
            and 10 bytes for decryption (in the latter case, it is
            actually the *encrypted* IV which was prefixed to the ciphertext).

            If not provided, a random byte string is generated (you must then
            read its value with the :attr:`iv` attribute).

        *   **nonce** (*byte string*) --
            (Only applicable for ``MODE_EAX`` and ``MODE_CTR``).

            A value that must never be reused for any other encryption done
            with this key.

            For ``MODE_EAX`` there are no
            restrictions on its length (recommended: **16** bytes).

            For ``MODE_CTR``, its length must be in the range **[0..7]**.

            If not provided for ``MODE_EAX``, a random byte string is generated (you
            can read it back via the ``nonce`` attribute).

        *   **segment_size** (*integer*) --
            (Only ``MODE_CFB``).The number of **bits** the plaintext and ciphertext
            are segmented in. It must be a multiple of 8.
            If not specified, it will be assumed to be 8.

        *   **mac_len** : (*integer*) --
            (Only ``MODE_EAX``)
            Length of the authentication tag, in bytes.
            It must be no longer than 8 (default).

        *   **initial_value** : (*integer*) --
            (Only ``MODE_CTR``). The initial value for the counter within
            the counter block. By default it is **0**.

    :Return: a DES object, of the applicable mode.
