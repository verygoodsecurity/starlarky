        the PKCS#5 standard (v1.5) or `RFC2898
        <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt>`_.

        Args:
         password (string):
            The secret password to generate the key from.
         salt (byte string):
            An 8 byte string to use for better protection from dictionary attacks.
            This value does not need to be kept secret, but it should be randomly
            chosen for each derivation.
         dkLen (integer):
            The length of the desired key. The default is 16 bytes, suitable for
            instance for :mod:`Crypto.Cipher.AES`.
         count (integer):
            The number of iterations to carry out. The recommendation is 1000 or
            more.
         hashAlgo (module):
            The hash algorithm to use, as a module or an object from the :mod:`Crypto.Hash` package.
            The digest length must be no shorter than ``dkLen``.
            The default algorithm is :mod:`Crypto.Hash.SHA1`.

        Return:
            A byte string of length ``dkLen`` that can be used as key.

    Derive one or more keys from a password (or passphrase).

        This function performs key derivation according to the PKCS#5 standard (v2.0).

        Args:
         password (string or byte string):
            The secret password to generate the key from.

            This value does not need to be kept secret, but it should be randomly
            chosen for each derivation. It is recommended to use at least 16 bytes.
         dkLen (integer):
            The cumulative length of the keys to produce.

            Due to a flaw in the PBKDF2 design, you should not request more bytes
            than the ``prf`` can output. For instance, ``dkLen`` should not exceed
            20 bytes in combination with ``HMAC-SHA1``.
         count (integer):
            The number of iterations to carry out. The higher the value, the slower
            and the more secure the function becomes.

            You should find the maximum number of iterations that keeps the
            key derivation still acceptable on the slowest hardware you must support.

            Although the default value is 1000, **it is recommended to use at least
            1000000 (1 million) iterations**.
         prf (callable):
            A pseudorandom function. It must be a function that returns a
            pseudorandom byte string from two parameters: a secret and a salt.
            The slower the algorithm, the more secure the derivation function.
            If not specified, **HMAC-SHA1** is used.
         hmac_hash_module (module):
            A module from ``Crypto.Hash`` implementing a Merkle-Damgard cryptographic
            hash, which PBKDF2 must use in combination with HMAC.
            This parameter is mutually exclusive with ``prf``.

        Return:
            A byte string of length ``dkLen`` that can be used as key material.
            If you want multiple keys, just break up this string into segments of the desired length.
