        .. note::
            Refer to `NIST SP 800 Part 1 Rev 4`_ (or newer release) for an
            overview of the recommended key lengths.

        :parameter key:
            The key to use for computing the signature (*private* keys only)
            or verifying one: it must be either
            :class:`Crypto.PublicKey.DSA` or :class:`Crypto.PublicKey.ECC`.

            For DSA keys, let ``L`` and ``N`` be the bit lengths of the modulus ``p``
            and of ``q``: the pair ``(L,N)`` must appear in the following list,
            in compliance to section 4.2 of `FIPS 186-4`_:

            - (1024, 160) *legacy only; do not create new signatures with this*
            - (2048, 224) *deprecated; do not create new signatures with this*
            - (2048, 256)
            - (3072, 256)

            For ECC, only keys over P-256, P384, and P-521 are accepted.
        :type key:
            a key object

        :parameter mode:
            The parameter can take these values:

            - *'fips-186-3'*. The signature generation is randomized and carried out
              according to `FIPS 186-3`_: the nonce ``k`` is taken from the RNG.
            - *'deterministic-rfc6979'*. The signature generation is not
              randomized. See RFC6979_.
        :type mode:
            string

        :parameter encoding:
            How the signature is encoded. This value determines the output of
            :meth:`sign` and the input to :meth:`verify`.

            The following values are accepted:

            - *'binary'* (default), the signature is the raw concatenation
              of ``r`` and ``s``. It is defined in the IEEE P.1363 standard.

              For DSA, the size in bytes of the signature is ``N/4`` bytes
              (e.g. 64 for ``N=256``).

              For ECDSA, the signature is always twice the length of a point
              coordinate (e.g. 64 bytes for P-256).

            - *'der'*, the signature is a ASN.1 DER SEQUENCE
              with two INTEGERs (``r`` and ``s``). It is defined in RFC3279_.
              The size of the signature is variable.
        :type encoding: string

        :parameter randfunc:
            A function that returns random *byte strings*, of a given length.
            If omitted, the internal RNG is used.
            Only applicable for the *'fips-186-3'* mode.
