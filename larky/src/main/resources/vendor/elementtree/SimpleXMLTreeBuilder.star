#
# A simple XML tree builder, based on Python's xmllib
#
# Note that due to bugs in xmllib, this builder does not fully support
# namespaces (unqualified attributes are put in the default namespace,
# instead of being left as is).  Run this module as a script to find
# out if this affects your Python version.
#
# history:
# 2001-10-20 fl   created
# 2002-05-01 fl   added namespace support for xmllib
# 2002-08-17 fl   added xmllib sanity test

# Tools to build element trees from XML files, using <b>xmllib</b>.
# This module can be used instead of the standard tree builder, for
# Python versions where "expat" is not available (such as 1.5.2).
# <p>
# Note that due to bugs in <b>xmllib</b>, the namespace support is
# not reliable (you can run the module as a script to find out exactly
# how unreliable it is on your Python version).
